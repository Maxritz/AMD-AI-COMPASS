"""
Utilities for merging capture trace information into graph replay traces.

This module provides functionality to extract events from a capture tree,
validate them against corresponding graph events, and merge them into an
augmented graph tree. The augmented tree combines both capture-time
information (actual kernel launches, memory operations) and graph replay
information (optimized execution paths), producing a complete execution
model suitable for performance analysis.
