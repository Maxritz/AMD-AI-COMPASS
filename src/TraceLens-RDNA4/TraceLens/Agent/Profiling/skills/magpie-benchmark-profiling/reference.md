# Magpie benchmark + profiling — reference

This file is the detailed specification for the TraceLens **magpie-benchmark-profiling** skill ([SKILL.md](SKILL.md)). Use it for every operational step: environment gathering, Docker patch builds, YAML and Magpie script edits, benchmark execution, trace verification, splitting, and pitfalls.

## Workflow overview

Steps **0–6**: collect SSH/conda details, read the Magpie YAML, optionally build a TraceLens-patched inference Docker image, enable and tune the PyTorch profiler (targeted steady-state vs full run), run `python -m Magpie benchmark` on the remote node, verify trace quality, then split rank-0 traces with `split_inference_trace_annotation` and print the suggested `generate_perf_report_pytorch_inference.py` command for downstream analysis.

---

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to a GPU node with Docker and AMD/NVIDIA GPUs
- A conda environment with Magpie installed (`pip install -e .` from the Magpie repo root)
- TraceLens installed on the host if TraceLens analysis is desired (`pip install -e .` from `TraceLens/`)
- HuggingFace model weights cached or an `HF_TOKEN` for gated models

## Workflow

### Step 0: Gather Execution Environment Details

Before doing anything else, check whether the user has provided all three of these:

1. **Target node** — the hostname or IP to SSH into (e.g., `gpu-node-3`)
2. **Conda environment name** — the env where Magpie is installed
3. **Conda install path** — defaults to `~/miniconda3`; ask only if conda activation fails

If any are missing, ask the user before proceeding. Example:

> "To run the benchmark I need a few details about your execution environment:
> 1. Which node should I SSH into?
> 2. What is the name of the conda environment with Magpie installed?
> 3. Is conda installed at `~/miniconda3`, or a different path?"

Do not guess node names or environment names — these are site-specific and getting them wrong wastes time on SSH failures or missing-package errors.

### Step 1: Read the Benchmark Config

The user provides a YAML config (typically under `Magpie/examples/`). Read it to understand the run parameters.

Key fields:

```yaml
benchmark:
  framework: vllm | sglang
  model: <HuggingFace model name>
  precision: fp8 | fp16 | bf16 | fp4

  envs:
    TP: 8              # tensor parallelism (GPU count)
    CONC: 32           # request concurrency
    ISL: 1024          # input sequence length
    OSL: 1024          # output sequence length

  profiler:
    torch_profiler:
      enabled: true    # MUST be true to collect traces
    system_profiler:
      enabled: false

  benchmark_script: "dsr1_fp8_mi300x.sh"  # optional override
  timeout_seconds: 3600
  hf_cache_path: "/path/to/hf/cache"
```

### Step 1b: Check Docker Image for Profiling Patches

After reading the config, work out whether the image needs profiling patches at all. The patches only exist to expose the profiler options used in Step 2b; TraceLens itself does **not** need to be installed inside the container, because the server only writes traces and every analysis step in this workflow runs on the host against the mounted output directory.

**For vLLM, check the version first.** Both profiler options ship in upstream vLLM from **v0.26.0** onwards ([vllm-project/vllm#37524](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/37524)), so a stock v0.26.0+ image is ready as-is — skip the rest of this step and go to Step 2. Only **v0.14-v0.25** need a patched image.

If the framework is SGLang, or the vLLM version is below v0.26.0 or unknown, ask:

> "Does the Docker image in your config (or the default image Magpie will select) already have the profiling patches applied? If you're unsure, I can build a patched image for you."

#### If the user's image is already patched

Proceed to Step 2. No changes needed.

#### If the user needs a patched image

Present the supported inference server and version options based on the `framework` field in the YAML config. **Do not hardcode the list of supported versions/GPU types here** — they change as new patches land. Instead, read the relevant docker build script and parse its `case` statement to discover the currently supported options, then present those to the user.

**For vLLM (`framework: vllm`):**

Read `examples/custom_workflows/inference_analysis/build_docker_vllm.sh` and extract each `vXX)` arm of the `case "${VLLM_VERSION}" in` block along with its `BASE_IMAGE`. Present the result as a table and ask the user to pick one, for example:

> "Which vLLM version would you like to build a patched image for?
>
> | Option | Version Tag | Base Image |
> |--------|-------------|------------|
> | 1 | `vXX` | `<base image from script>` |
> | ... | ... | ... |"

Once the user selects a version, build the patched image on the remote node:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <TraceLens_repo> && \
  bash examples/custom_workflows/inference_analysis/build_docker_vllm.sh \
    <version_tag> \
    <TraceLens_repo> \
    -t tracelens-vllm"
```

Where `<version_tag>` is one of the `vXX` tags listed in the script's `case` statement.

The script only carries arms for versions that still need a patch, and rejects anything newer with a message saying the options are upstream. If the user asks for a version it does not list, do not look for a workaround — tell them to run the stock upstream image for that version. The profiler flags in Step 2b are identical for patched and upstream images, so nothing else in this workflow changes.

**For SGLang (`framework: sglang`):**

Read `examples/custom_workflows/inference_analysis/build_docker_sglang.sh`. The script supports two dimensions selected via flags: `--sglang-version` and `--gpu-type`. Discover the currently supported combinations by parsing the script (do **not** hardcode the lists in this skill — they change as new versions land):

- Parse the `normalize_version()` function to enumerate accepted SGLang version tokens (the canonical version is whatever the function `echo`s, e.g. `0.5.9`, `0.5.11`).
- Parse the `resolve_base_image()` function's `case "${version}:${gpu}" in` block to enumerate the full `(version, gpu_type) -> base_image` matrix. Each arm pattern like `0.5.9:mi350|0.5.9:mi355)` expands to one row per `version:gpu` pair.

Present the discovered matrix to the user as a table and ask them to pick one row:

> "Which SGLang version + GPU combination should I build a patched image for?
>
> | Option | SGLang Version | GPU Type | Base Image |
> |--------|----------------|----------|------------|
> | 1 | `<version>` | `<gpu_type>` | `<base image from script>` |
> | ... | ... | ... | ... |"

Once the user selects, build the patched image on the remote node using the explicit flag form:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <TraceLens_repo> && \
  bash examples/custom_workflows/inference_analysis/build_docker_sglang.sh \
    <TraceLens_repo> \
    --sglang-version <version> \
    --gpu-type <gpu_type> \
    -t tracelens-sglang"
```

The script starts a container from the resolved base image, applies the matching sglang roofline patches from `sglang_roofline_patches/sglang_<ver_with_underscores>/` (auto-derived from `--sglang-version`), and installs TraceLens inside it.

**After building:** Update the `docker_image` field in the benchmark YAML config to use the newly built image:

```yaml
benchmark:
  framework: vllm  # or sglang
  docker_image: tracelens-vllm  # or the sglang container name
  ...
```

This overrides the default auto-selected image from `benchmark_images.yaml`.

#### If the user declines

Proceed with the user's chosen image. Warn that traces may lack kernel-level detail for graph-replayed operations, and roofline analysis may not be available.

### Step 2: Ensure Profiling Is Enabled

If the user wants a profiler trace, verify `profiler.torch_profiler.enabled` is `true` in the YAML. If it is `false`, edit it to `true` before running.

When enabled, the benchmarker automatically sets these env vars inside the container:
- `PROFILE=1`
- `VLLM_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR=/workspace/torch_trace`
- `SGLANG_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR=/workspace/torch_trace`

No manual env var configuration is needed.

### Step 2b: Ask About Profiler Tuning

Before running the benchmark, ask the user whether they want to profile a targeted steady-state window or the entire benchmark run. This applies to **both vLLM and SGLang** frameworks (the mechanism differs but the formulas are the same).

#### Common profiler flags (apply for both Option A and Option B)

The flags below must be applied **regardless** of whether the user chooses targeted-window or full-benchmark profiling. They enable graph-capture tracing, detailed annotations, and shape discovery that are required for downstream TraceLens analysis.

##### Common vLLM flags

> **Before setting `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` or `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS`:** check which script will run. If `benchmark_script` is not set in the YAML, Magpie looks for an InferenceX native script named `gptoss_{precision}_{runner}.sh` (for vLLM) or `dsr1_{precision}_{runner}.sh` (for SGLang) and selects it if found. SSH to the node and check:
> ```bash
> ssh <node> "find <magpie_repo>/InferenceX/benchmarks -name 'gptoss_*' -o -name 'dsr1_*' | head -5"
> ```
> If a native script is found (or if `benchmark_script` is explicitly set to an InferenceX native script), `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`/`EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` will be silently ignored. In that case, **stop and ask the user to set `benchmark_script` in their YAML to the appropriate Magpie generic script** (e.g. `vllm_mi300x.sh`) before proceeding.

Add these flags to `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` in the user's YAML config (append to any existing value):

```yaml
benchmark:
  envs:
    EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS: "... --profiler-config.capture_torch_profiler True --profiler-config.detailed_trace_annotation True"
```

- `--profiler-config.capture_torch_profiler True` — enables graph-capture tracing. vLLM writes separate traces for the CUDA graph capture phases into `<torch_profiler_dir>/capture_traces` (i.e. `/workspace/torch_trace/capture_traces` under Magpie's container mount), which are needed for downstream TraceLens analysis of graph-replayed operations.
- `--profiler-config.detailed_trace_annotation True` — enables detailed annotations in the trace (iteration boundaries, phase labels, scheduling metadata). These annotations are required by `split_inference_trace_annotation` for accurate trace splitting.

Both flags take the same form on every supported version: they come from the TraceLens patch on vLLM **v0.14-v0.25** and from upstream vLLM on **v0.26.0 and later**.

##### Common SGLang flags

Apply **three** edits regardless of profiling mode:

**1. Add profiling env vars to the user's YAML config.**

```yaml
benchmark:
  envs:
    SGLANG_PROFILE_WITH_STACK: "True"
    SGLANG_PROFILE_RECORD_SHAPE: "True"
```

These enable call-stack capture and tensor shape recording in the profiler trace, which are required for TraceLens roofline analysis and kernel attribution.

**2. Add graph-capture profiling flags as `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` in the user's YAML config.**

```yaml
benchmark:
  envs:
    EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS: "--enable-profile-cuda-graph --enable-shape-discovery-for-cuda-graph-profile"
```

If the YAML already has an `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` field with existing flags, **append** these flags to the existing value rather than replacing it.

- `--enable-profile-cuda-graph` — makes CUDA graph-replayed operations individually traced rather than appearing as a single opaque graph-launch kernel. Without this flag, the profiler cannot see inside replayed graphs and roofline analysis is incomplete.
- `--enable-shape-discovery-for-cuda-graph-profile` — records tensor shapes for operations inside CUDA graphs, enabling accurate roofline modelling of graph-replayed kernels.

**3. Patch `benchmark_serving.py` to enable shape discovery and roofline annotations in the profile request body.**

The file is at `<magpie_repo>/InferenceX/utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py`. The existing code has `"num_steps": 1` hardcoded in the `extra_body` dict. Add `shape_discovery` and `roofline_annotations` flags:

```bash
ssh <node> "sed -i 's/\"num_steps\": 1, \"merge_profiles\": True, \"profile_by_stage\": True/\"shape_discovery\": True, \"roofline_annotations\": True, \"num_steps\": 1, \"merge_profiles\": True, \"profile_by_stage\": True/' \
  <magpie_repo>/InferenceX/utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py"
```

- `shape_discovery: True` — enables tensor shape recording for CUDA graph operations during profiling.
- `roofline_annotations: True` — adds FLOPs and memory bandwidth annotations needed for roofline analysis.

#### Profiling mode

Ask:

> "Would you like to profile a **targeted steady-state window** (recommended — smaller traces, captures steady-state decode) or the **entire benchmark** run?"

##### Option A: Targeted steady-state window (delay + max iterations)

Compute recommended `delay_iterations` and `max_iterations` from the YAML config values. Read `OSL`, `CONC`, and `RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO` from the `envs` section (default `RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO` to `1.0` if absent).

**Formulas:**

```
max_iters = min(1024, max(256,OSL * 16 / CONC))

delay_iters = ( OSL * (RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO + 1 ) * 3 ) - (max_iters/2)

```

Compute the values, round to integers, then present them to the user for confirmation:

> "Based on your config (OSL=X, CONC=Y, RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO=Z), I'd suggest:
> - **delay_iterations** = A  (skip A engine iterations before profiling)
> - **max_iterations** = B  (profile B iterations then stop)
>
> This targets steady-state decode after warmup. Does this look good, or would you like different values?"

Once the user confirms (or provides overrides), apply the framework-specific edits below.

---

###### vLLM targeted window

Apply **two** temporary edits:

**1. Add profiler iteration args as `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` and raise `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in the user's YAML config.**

Instead of patching the benchmark shell script, add the profiler arguments to the `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` environment variable in the YAML config's `envs` section. The benchmark script already passes `$EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` to the `vllm serve` command, so no script edits are needed.

Edit the user's YAML config file to add (or append to) the `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` field under `benchmark.envs`, and set `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to `1200`:

```yaml
benchmark:
  envs:
    EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS: "--profiler-config.delay_iterations <DELAY> --profiler-config.max_iterations <MAX> --profiler-config.ignore_frontend True"
    VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: "1200"
```

If the YAML already has an `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` field with existing flags, **append** the profiler flags to the existing value rather than replacing it.

`ignore_frontend` must be `True` when using delay/max iterations, otherwise the AsyncLLM front-end profiler captures the entire range and adds significant overhead.

`VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: "1200"` is required because the torch profiler adds substantial per-iteration overhead during the targeted window. The default `execute_model` watchdog timeout is too short and will abort the engine mid-profile; raising it to 1200s gives the profiled iterations enough headroom to complete.

**2. MANDATORY: Increase `num_prompts` in `benchmark_lib.sh` so the benchmark runs long enough for the profiling window.**

**This patch is always required when using delay + max iterations.** The `run_benchmark_serving` function in `benchmark_lib.sh` **unconditionally overrides** `num_prompts` when `PROFILE=1` — this happens *after* parsing the `--num-prompts` argument, so it stomps whatever value the calling script (e.g. `vllm_mi300x.sh`) passes. Do NOT skip this patch even if the calling script already sets a larger `--num-prompts`. Without this fix, the benchmark finishes before the delay window is reached, and no steady-state trace is captured.

```bash
ssh <node> "sed -i 's/num_prompts=\"\$max_concurrency\"/num_prompts=\"\$((max_concurrency * 10))\"/' \
  <magpie_repo>/InferenceX/benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh"
```

Replace `10` with a different multiplier if the user requests it.

---

###### SGLang targeted window

SGLang profiling is controlled **client-side** via the `/start_profile` HTTP endpoint, not via server CLI args. The benchmark client (`benchmark_serving.py`) sends a POST to `/start_profile` with an `extra_body` dict. The common SGLang flags (env vars, `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS`, `shape_discovery`, `roofline_annotations`) were already applied in the shared section above. Apply **two** additional edits for targeted windowing:

**1. Patch `benchmark_serving.py` to set `start_step` and `num_steps`.**

The common section already patched `benchmark_serving.py` to add `shape_discovery` and `roofline_annotations`. Now apply a second sed to set the targeted window parameters:

```bash
ssh <node> "sed -i 's/\"num_steps\": 1, \"merge_profiles\": True, \"profile_by_stage\": True/\"start_step\": <DELAY>, \"num_steps\": <MAX>, \"merge_profiles\": False, \"profile_by_stage\": False/' \
  <magpie_repo>/InferenceX/utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py"
```

Where `<DELAY>` is the computed `delay_iters` and `<MAX>` is the computed `max_iters`. This maps to SGLang's `/start_profile` API:
- `start_step` = step number at which profiling begins (equivalent to vLLM's `delay_iterations`)
- `num_steps` = number of steps to profile (equivalent to vLLM's `max_iterations`)

SGLang will skip `start_step` engine iterations (warmup), then profile for `num_steps` iterations before auto-stopping.

**2. MANDATORY: Increase `num_prompts` in `benchmark_lib.sh` so the benchmark runs long enough for the profiling window.**

This is the same patch as for vLLM — `benchmark_lib.sh` is shared between both frameworks:

```bash
ssh <node> "sed -i 's/num_prompts=\"\$max_concurrency\"/num_prompts=\"\$((max_concurrency * 10))\"/' \
  <magpie_repo>/InferenceX/benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh"
```

Replace `10` with a different multiplier if the user requests it. Without this fix, the benchmark finishes before the `start_step` window is reached, and no steady-state trace is captured.

---

##### Option B: Profile the entire benchmark

Do **not** add `start_step`/`delay_iterations` args or increase `num_prompts`. The common flags from the shared section above **still apply** and must be present:
- **vLLM:** No `delay_iterations` / `max_iterations` — the profiler captures everything from start to finish. The common vLLM flags (`capture_torch_profiler`, `detailed_trace_annotation`) must be in `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`.
- **SGLang:** `num_steps` stays at `1` (or user can manually increase it without setting `start_step`). The common SGLang flags (env vars `SGLANG_PROFILE_WITH_STACK`/`SGLANG_PROFILE_RECORD_SHAPE`, `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` with graph-capture flags, and the `shape_discovery`/`roofline_annotations` patch to `benchmark_serving.py`) must all be applied.
- `num_prompts` stays at `CONC` — keeps the trace to a manageable size since every iteration is profiled.

Warn the user that full-benchmark traces will be very large (potentially several GB per rank for large models).

#### Cleanup

All edits in Step 2b are temporary.

**For vLLM:** The YAML config was modified (to add/update `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`). If using targeted window (Option A), `benchmark_lib.sh` was also patched. Back up `benchmark_lib.sh` before patching:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <magpie_repo>/InferenceX && \
  cp benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh.bak"
```

After the benchmark completes, restore `benchmark_lib.sh` and remove the `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` profiler flags from the YAML config (or revert to the original YAML):

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <magpie_repo>/InferenceX && \
  mv benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh.bak benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh"
```

Then edit the user's YAML config to remove the profiler flags from `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` (or restore the original value if it had pre-existing flags).

**For SGLang:** The YAML config was modified (to add profiling env vars and `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS`) and `benchmark_serving.py` was patched (common flags). If using targeted window (Option A), `benchmark_lib.sh` was also patched. Back up the remote files before patching:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <magpie_repo>/InferenceX && \
  cp benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh.bak && \
  cp utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py.bak"
```

After the benchmark completes, restore the remote files:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <magpie_repo>/InferenceX && \
  mv benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh.bak benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh && \
  mv utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py.bak utils/bench_serving/benchmark_serving.py"
```

Then edit the user's YAML config to remove the profiling env vars (`SGLANG_PROFILE_WITH_STACK`, `SGLANG_PROFILE_RECORD_SHAPE`) and the `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` profiler flags (or restore the original values if they had pre-existing content).

Alternatively, if InferenceX is a git checkout, use `git checkout -- <file>` to discard changes. Or delete the entire `InferenceX` directory — Magpie re-clones it on the next run.

### Step 3: Run the Benchmark

SSH into the target node, activate the conda environment, and run:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <magpie_repo_root> && \
  source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && \
  conda activate <env_name> && \
  python -m Magpie benchmark --benchmark-config <path/to/config.yaml> 2>&1"
```

Run this as a background command (`block_until_ms: 0`) since benchmarks take 5-30+ minutes depending on model size.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

The main process logs are sparse during container execution. To see detailed progress:

1. **Check container status:**
   ```bash
   ssh <node> "docker ps --filter 'name=magpie' --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'"
   ```

2. **Check container logs for model loading and benchmark progress:**
   ```bash
   ssh <node> "docker logs <container_name> 2>&1 | tail -40"
   ```

3. **Key milestones in container logs:**
   - `"The server is fired up and ready to roll!"` — model loaded, server ready
   - `"Warming up with N requests..."` — warmup phase (pre-profiling)
   - `"Starting profiler..."` — profiling active, benchmark running
   - Progress bars for warmup and benchmark requests

4. **Container disappears when done** (it runs with `--rm`). Once the container is gone, check the main process terminal for the final summary.

### Step 5: Verify Trace Quality

After completion, verify trace artifacts in the results workspace:

```bash
# List all trace files and sizes
ls -lh <workspace>/torch_trace/

# Verify trace contains GPU kernels
python3 -c "
import json, gzip
with gzip.open('<workspace>/torch_trace/<trace_file>', 'rt') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
events = data.get('traceEvents', [])
cats = {}
for e in events:
    cat = e.get('cat', 'no_cat')
    cats[cat] = cats.get(cat, 0) + 1
print(f'Total events: {len(events)}')
for cat, cnt in sorted(cats.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:10]:
    print(f'  {cat}: {cnt}')
"
```

**Quality checklist:**

| Check | Expected | If it fails |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Trace files exist in `torch_trace/` | At least one `.trace.json.gz` per rank | Profiler not enabled; check config |
| Each file > 100KB | SGLang: EXTEND ~4-5MB, DECODE ~150KB. vLLM: ~100-150MB per rank for large models with graph replay | Profiling window too short or no GPU ops |
| `kernel` category present | Hundreds to thousands of kernel events | `ProfilerActivity.CUDA` not captured |
| Multiple event categories | `cpu_op`, `kernel`, `cuda_runtime`, `python_function` | Partial trace; re-run |

**SGLang trace naming convention:**
- `<id>-TP-{rank}-DECODE.trace.json.gz` — decode phase per rank
- `<id>-TP-{rank}-EXTEND.trace.json.gz` — prefill/extend phase per rank
- `merged-<id>.trace.json.gz` — combined view across all ranks
- Expect `2 * TP` per-rank files + 1 merged file

**vLLM trace naming convention:**
- `*-rank-{N}.*.pt.trace.json.gz` — one GPU trace per rank
- `*async_llm.*.pt.trace.json.gz` — CPU-side AsyncLLM trace
- `profiler_out_{N}.txt` — profiler summary text per rank
- Expect `TP` rank files + 1 async_llm file + `TP` profiler_out files

### Step 6: Split Traces for Analysis

All vLLM and sglang traces — regardless of whether they were collected in eager mode or graph-replay mode — must be split before running TraceLens analysis. The raw per-rank traces are large (vLLM: ~100-150MB, 5-9M events; sglang: smaller but still benefit from splitting) and `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch` cannot handle them efficiently without preprocessing (it will hang or run for 10+ minutes with no output).

Run trace preprocessing on the rank-0 trace file:

```bash
ssh <node> "source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate <env> && \
  cd <TraceLens_repo> && \
  python -m TraceLens.TraceUtils.split_inference_trace_annotation \
    <workspace>/torch_trace/<rank-0-trace>.pt.trace.json.gz \
    -o <workspace>/torch_trace/trace_split \
    --find-steady-state --num-steps 32 \
    --CONC <conc> --OSL <osl> --R <r>"
```

Replace `<conc>`, `<osl>`, and `<r>` with the benchmark parameters (e.g. `--CONC 32 --OSL 1024 --R 0.5`). These are used to derive the ideal prefill-decode ratio for mixed-window selection; see [Inference_analysis.md](../../docs/Inference_analysis.md) for details.

This produces up to 3 trace files plus metadata in `trace_split/` (a window may be skipped if no matching run exists in the largest steady-state region):
- `mixed_steady_state_*.json.gz` — representative DO:PD mix (closest to the reference or `--CONC/--OSL/--R`-derived ideal ratio). **Use this for analysis.**
- `prefilldecode_steady_state_*.json.gz` — longest pure prefill-decode-mix run (capped at `--num-steps`)
- `decode_only_steady_state_*.json.gz` — longest pure decode-only run (capped at `--num-steps`)
- `execution_details.json` / `execution_details.csv` — per-window metadata (event counts, GPU duration/busy, phase breakdown)

Then construct and print the following command for the user to run manually (do **not** execute it). Fill in the absolute paths based on the workspace and split output:

```
python <TraceLens_repo>/TraceLens/Reporting/generate_perf_report_pytorch_inference.py \
    --capture_folder <workspace>/torch_trace/capture_traces \
    --profile_json_path <workspace>/torch_trace/trace_split/<split_trace>.json.gz \
    --output_csvs_dir <workspace>/torch_trace/analysis_output \
    --group_by_parent_module --enable_pseudo_ops --group_by_num_kernels
```

Use absolute paths for all three arguments. The `--profile_json_path` should point to the `*_annotation_iteration_0_*.json.gz` file from the split output.

## CLI Reference

```
python -m Magpie benchmark --benchmark-config <config.yaml>
python -m Magpie benchmark --benchmark-config <config.yaml> --run-mode local
python -m Magpie benchmark gap-analysis --trace-dir <results_dir>
```

CLI args can override YAML fields: `--torch-profiler`, `--tp N`, `--model <name>`, `--timeout N`, `--docker-image <img>`, `--output-dir <dir>`.

## Pitfalls

### 1. `--log-level` is not a valid CLI argument

The benchmark subcommand does not accept `--log-level`. Passing it causes an argparse error because it gets parsed as a positional argument for the `benchmark_action` sub-subparser (which only accepts `gap-analysis`). Omit it entirely.

### 2. No output during Docker container startup

The main Magpie process emits a "Running benchmark in container with image: ..." log line and then goes silent for several minutes while Docker starts the container, loads the model, and runs warmup. This is normal. Monitor progress by checking `docker logs` on the remote node rather than waiting for the main process.

### 3. Large models need long timeouts

DeepSeek-R1 and similarly large models can take 3-5 minutes just to load weights. Use `timeout_seconds: 3600` (1 hour) or more. The default is usually sufficient but do not reduce it for large models.

### 4. Traces are bind-mounted, not copied

The workspace directory is mounted into the container at `/workspace`. Trace files written inside the container appear directly on the host. There is no `docker cp` step. If the workspace path is wrong, traces will be missing.

### 5. Container is auto-removed

The container runs with `--rm`, so it disappears after completion. If you need to inspect container state after a failure, look at `benchmark_stdout.log` and `benchmark_stderr.log` in the workspace, or `server.log` for server-side issues.

### 6. SSH command quoting

When running the benchmark over SSH via the Shell tool, quote the entire remote command as a single string. Conda activation requires sourcing the conda init script explicitly:

```bash
ssh <node> "cd <repo> && source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate <env> && python -m Magpie benchmark ... 2>&1"
```

### 7. Config field: `torch_profiler.enabled` defaults to `true`

In the Python config dataclass, `TorchProfilerConfig.enabled` defaults to `True`. But many example YAML files explicitly set it to `false`. Always check the actual YAML the user points to.

### 8. `benchmark_lib.sh` unconditionally overrides `num_prompts` when profiling

When `PROFILE=1`, the `run_benchmark_serving` function in `benchmark_lib.sh` **unconditionally** sets `num_prompts="$max_concurrency"` *after* parsing all `--num-prompts` arguments. This means even if the calling benchmark script (e.g. `vllm_mi300x.sh`) explicitly passes `--num-prompts $(( $CONC * 10 ))`, that value gets overwritten. When using `delay_iterations` + `max_iterations` for steady-state profiling, you **must** patch `benchmark_lib.sh` to increase this multiplier, otherwise the benchmark ends before the profiling window starts and no trace is captured.

### 9. `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` / `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` are silently ignored by InferenceX native scripts

InferenceX native scripts (`gptoss_fp4_mi300x.sh`, `dsr1_fp8_mi300x.sh`, etc.) hardcode their own `vllm serve` invocation and do not reference `$EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`/`EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS`. Magpie selects these over its own generic scripts for named models, so flags set in `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`/`EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` silently have no effect. Set `benchmark_script` in the YAML to the appropriate Magpie generic script (e.g. `vllm_mi300x.sh`) to ensure `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`/`EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` is passed through.

### 10. The `hf_cache_path` field avoids re-downloading models

If the node has a shared HuggingFace cache, set `hf_cache_path` in the config to avoid multi-hour model downloads. This path is mounted into the container.


## Optional: Post-Benchmark Analysis

After collecting traces, you can run additional analysis:

**Gap analysis** (kernel bottleneck report):
```bash
python -m Magpie benchmark gap-analysis --trace-dir <results_dir> \
    --start-pct 50 --end-pct 80 --top-k 20
```

**TraceLens analysis** (enable in YAML):
```yaml
  profiler:
    tracelens:
      enabled: true
      export_format: csv
      perf_report_enabled: true
      multi_rank_report_enabled: true
```

TraceLens requires the `TraceLens` package installed on the host (not inside the container).
