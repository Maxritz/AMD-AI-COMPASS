"""
Test cases covered:

overlapping_uids computation (GPUEventAnalyser):
- No events / single event -> no overlaps
- Two non-overlapping events -> each has empty overlapping_uids
- Two overlapping events -> each has the other's UID
- Two touching at boundary -> NOT overlapping (end processed before start at same time)
- Three events with one containing the other two -> all pairs overlap
- overlapping_uids are sets; self not in overlapping_uids; kernel + gpu_memcpy mix
- Same cpu_op: overlapping kernels under the same cpu_op are NOT marked overlapping
- Different cpu_ops: overlapping kernels under different cpu_ops ARE marked overlapping
- Mixed: some kernels share a cpu_op, others don't
- Same stream: overlapping kernels on the same stream are NOT marked overlapping
- Different streams: overlapping kernels on different streams ARE marked overlapping
- Missing stream info: conservatively falls back to marking as overlapping
- Same stream + different cpu_ops: stream check takes priority, NOT marked overlapping
- Sub-microsecond overlap (<1µs) filtered as timestamp noise (Bug 1 regression)
- Exactly 1µs overlap meets threshold and IS marked (strict < 1.0 check)
- Above-threshold overlap (>1µs) correctly marked
- Zero-duration GPU events do not raise:
    same-UID end (0) sorts before start (1) at equal timestamps; the sweep-line
    must skip zero-measure intervals from active_uids tracking.
- ROCm legacy rocclr copy/fill kernels (cat=kernel with rocclr-internal names
    used by ROCm 7.1) are rerouted to memcpy_events / comp_events to match
    ROCm 7.2's cat=gpu_memcpy / cat=gpu_memset bucketing for cross-version
    report comparability.

overlap_pct computation (via kernel launchers and DataFrames):
- Partial overlap between kernels from different cpu_ops
- Full containment (one kernel entirely within another)
- No overlap -> no overlapping_kernels_details entries
- Exact same interval -> overlap_pct = 1.0
- Boundary touching -> not overlapping
- Multiple overlapping kernels with different overlap fractions
- Multi-kernel cpu_op with partial / spanning overlap (merged runtime denominator)
- overlap_pct appears as a top-level DataFrame column, rounded to hundredths
- overlap_pct survives aggregation in unique-args kl_overlap
