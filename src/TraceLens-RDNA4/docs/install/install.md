This topic provides step-by-step instructions to install TraceLens and verify
the installation. TraceLens is distributed as a Python package; install it with
`pip` either directly from the public GitHub repository (recommended) or from a
local source checkout for development.

## Before you begin

Confirm you have the following before installing TraceLens.

- **No GPU required to run TraceLens.** TraceLens analyzes trace files on any
  host; it does not execute GPU kernels. GPU hardware and ROCm are only required
  by the profiling tools that *produce* the traces (for example, `rocprofv3`).
  See the [compatibility matrix](../reference/compatibility.md) for details.

- Python 3.6 or later (3.10 recommended). Confirm your version:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

- A recent `pip`. Upgrade it inside your environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- (Recommended) An isolated virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Method 1: Install from GitHub (recommended)

Install the latest TraceLens directly from the public repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git
```

This installs TraceLens and its dependencies and places the `TraceLens_*`
command-line tools on your `PATH`.

## Method 2: Install from source (development)

Use an editable install when you want to modify TraceLens or run its test
suite. The `[dev]` extra installs the development and test dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git && cd TraceLens
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Optional: `traceconv` for `.pftrace` input

`traceconv` is needed only when you pass a Perfetto-style `.pftrace` trace
(produced by `rocprofv3 --output-format pftrace`) to one of the pftrace report
tools (`TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pftrace_hip_activity`, `..._hip_api`, or
`..._memory_copy`); it converts the `.pftrace` to JSON. The other report tools
(PyTorch, JAX, rocprofv3 JSON) don't use it. TraceLens looks for `traceconv` on your `PATH`; if it isn't found, it
downloads it automatically from `https://get.perfetto.dev` into the trace
file's directory (network access required). To use a specific binary instead,
pass `--traceconv /path/to/traceconv` to any pftrace tool.

## Verify the installation

Run the following checks to confirm TraceLens is installed correctly:

1. Confirm the package imports:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "import TraceLens; print('TraceLens import OK')"
   ```

2. Confirm the command-line tools are available:

   ```bash
   TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch --help
   ```

   Expected output: the tool prints its usage and the list of accepted
   arguments (for example, `--profile_json_path`) and exits without error.

3. (Optional) Generate a report from a bundled demo trace to confirm end-to-end
   operation. The repository ships sample traces under `tests/traces/`, so run
   this from a source checkout (see Method 2):

   ```bash
   TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch \
       --profile_json_path tests/traces/mi300/Qwen_Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat__1016005.json.gz
   ```

   Expected output: an Excel report (`.xlsx`) is written next to the trace,
   containing the GPU-timeline and operator-summary sheets.
