# What is TraceLens?
```{meta}
:description: Learn what TraceLens is and what it does — an open-source Python library from AMD for automated GPU trace analysis, roofline modeling, and distributed workload profiling.

```

TraceLens is an open-source Python library developed by AMD that automates
performance analysis from GPU trace files. Instead of manually inspecting raw
profiling data in tools such as Perfetto or Chrome Trace Viewer, TraceLens
parses traces from PyTorch, JAX, and `rocprofv3` and produces structured
performance reports — including hierarchical GPU-timeline breakdowns,
per-operator roofline analysis (TFLOP/s, TB/s), and multi-GPU communication
diagnostics.

TraceLens can pinpoint whether a kernel is compute-bound or memory-bound,
separate true communication time from synchronization skew in distributed
workloads, and compare traces side-by-side to quantify the impact of code or
configuration changes. It's available as a set of command-line tools for
quick report generation and as a Python SDK for building custom analysis
workflows, making it useful for one-off debugging and repeatable performance
regression testing alike.

The TraceLens source code is hosted at
[github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens).

## What TraceLens does

TraceLens provides these capabilities:

- **Hierarchical performance breakdowns:** Pinpoint bottlenecks with a
  top-down view, moving from the overall GPU timeline (idle/busy) to operator
  categories, individual operators, and right down to unique argument shapes.
- **Compute and roofline modeling:** Translate raw timings into efficiency
  metrics such as TFLOP/s and TB/s. Determine whether an operation is compute-
  or memory-bound and see how effectively your code uses the hardware.
- **Multi-GPU communication analysis:** Diagnose scaling issues by dissecting
  collective operations. TraceLens separates pure communication time from
  synchronization skew and calculates effective bandwidth on your real
  workload.
- **Trace comparison:** Quantify the impact of changes with trace diffing at
  the CPU-dispatch level, enabling meaningful side-by-side comparisons across
  hardware and software versions.
- **Event replay:** Isolate any operation for focused debugging. TraceLens
  generates minimal, self-contained replay scripts from trace metadata, making
  it straightforward to share IP-safe reproducers with kernel developers.
- **Extensible SDK:** Start with ready-to-use scripts, then build custom
  workflows with a flexible Python API.

## Use cases

TraceLens is suited to these scenarios:

- **Performance debugging:** Find the operators and kernels responsible for low
  GPU utilization in a training or inference workload.
- **Roofline efficiency analysis:** Measure how close each operator runs to the
  hardware's compute and memory-bandwidth limits on a given accelerator.
- **Distributed scaling analysis:** Quantify exposed communication and
  synchronization skew across ranks in multi-GPU and multi-node runs.
- **Regression testing:** Compare a baseline trace against a candidate to
  quantify the effect of a code, library, or hardware change.
- **Reproducer generation:** Extract a single operator into a standalone replay
  script to share with kernel or framework developers.

## Supported profile formats

TraceLens supports the following trace formats:

| Format | Source tool | Report CLI |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| PyTorch | `torch.profiler` | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch` |
| PyTorch (inference) | `torch.profiler` | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch_inference` |
| JAX | XPlane protobuf | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_jax` |
| rocprofv3 JSON | AMD ROCm ROCprofiler-SDK | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_rocprof` |
| rocprofv3 pftrace (Perfetto-style) | `rocprofv3 --output-format pftrace` | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pftrace_hip_activity`, `..._pftrace_hip_api`, `..._pftrace_memory_copy` |

```{note}
TraceLens analyzes trace files and does not execute GPU kernels, so report
generation runs on any host with a supported Python version — no GPU or ROCm
installation is required. The PyTorch report is well tested on traces from both
AMD ROCm and NVIDIA CUDA workloads. GPU hardware is only needed by the
profiling tools that *capture* the traces. Roofline bound classification
additionally requires an architecture specification; bundled specs cover AMD
Instinct accelerators, and custom JSON specs can be supplied for other
hardware. See the [compatibility matrix](./reference/compatibility.md) for
details.
