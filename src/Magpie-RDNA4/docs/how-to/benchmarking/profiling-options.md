# Profiling options in Magpie's benchmark mode

Magpie supports three profiling backends that can be enabled independently and combined in a single benchmark run: the torch profiler captures per-rank JSON traces, TraceLens runs inference-aware analysis on those traces to produce prefill/decode performance reports, and gap analysis aggregates kernel durations from the traces to identify the operations that dominate runtime. Each backend is configured under the `profiler:` key in your benchmark YAML and writes its output to a dedicated subdirectory in the benchmark workspace. Enable only the backends you need — torch profiler is a prerequisite for both TraceLens and gap analysis, but TraceLens and gap analysis are independent of each other.

```{note}
Profiling is an optional feature of Magpie's benchmark mode. For a full overview
of benchmark mode, including run modes, configuration, and output structure, see
[Benchmark frameworks with Magpie](benchmark.md).
```

## Torch profiler

When `torch_profiler.enabled: true`, Magpie takes the following actions.

- Sets `VLLM_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR` automatically
- Generates JSON trace files for each GPU rank
- Traces saved to: `results/benchmark_<framework>_<timestamp>/torch_trace/`

## TraceLens analysis

TraceLens provides automated analysis of torch profiler traces:

| Command | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `TraceLens_`<br>`split_`<br>`inference`<br>`_trace` | Split vLLM/SGLang inference traces into phase windows | `torch_trace/trace_split/` |
| `TraceLens_`<br>`generate_perf`<br>`_report_pytorch`<br>`_inference` | Inference-aware prefill/decode reports and compact roofline summaries | `tracelens/` |
| `TraceLens_`<br>`generate_perf`<br>`_report_pytorch` | Single-rank performance report | `tracelens_rank0_csvs/` |
| `TraceLens_`<br>`generate_multi`<br>`_rank_collective`<br>`_report_pytorch` | Multi-rank collective analysis | `tracelens_collective_csvs/` |

`analysis_mode` defaults to `inference`, which is the recommended mode for
vLLM/SGLang benchmarks. It automatically enables the torch profiler, patches the
needed InferenceX profiling helpers for the run, splits the rank-0 trace, and
runs reports for all inference stages. Use `analysis_mode: pytorch` to keep the
legacy direct PyTorch report flow.

For Docker benchmarks, `auto_patch_runtime` defaults to `true`. When TraceLens
inference mode is enabled and the selected runtime image is not already
TraceLens-ready, Magpie builds a derived image from supported official
vLLM/SGLang tags using the public TraceLens workflow scripts. The derived image
is tagged locally as `magpie-tracelens-<framework>:...` and reused on later runs.
If no TraceLens source path is configured, Magpie shallow clones the official
TraceLens `main` branch to
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/magpie/TraceLens` (or `~/.cache/magpie/TraceLens`) and reuses
that checkout. It does not scan other local directories for TraceLens. Set
`profiler.tracelens.tracelens_repo_path` or `TRACELENS_REPO_PATH` to use a
specific checkout instead. An invalid explicit path is reported as an error and
does not fall back to `main`.

To install an optional local TraceLens extension in the derived image, set
`extension_wheel_path`:

```yaml
profiler:
  tracelens:
    enabled: true
    auto_patch_runtime: true
    extension_wheel_path: /secure/path/to/TraceLens_extension.whl
```

Magpie infers the extension's import module from its wheel layout, installs the
wheel with `--no-deps` as a final image layer, and adds the module to
`TL_EXTENSION`. The wheel SHA-256 is included in the derived image tag, so a
changed wheel creates a new image instead of silently reusing an older one.
The wheel remains in a temporary Docker build context and is not copied into
the public TraceLens checkout. This option also works when `docker_image`
already names a TraceLens-ready image.

For `run_mode: docker`, TraceLens inference post-processing also runs inside the
resolved runtime image after the benchmark container exits. The post-processing
container is CPU-only, mounts the benchmark workspace at `/workspace`, and writes
CSV outputs under `tracelens/`. Host Python only needs Docker; it does not need
the TraceLens CLI on `PATH`.

`analysis_stages` defaults to `all`:

```yaml
profiler:
  tracelens:
    enabled: true
    analysis_stages: all
```

To run only selected stages:

```yaml
profiler:
  tracelens:
    enabled: true
    analysis_stages: [prefill, decode]
```

Supported stage names are `prefilldecode` (alias: `mixed`), `prefill`, and
`decode`. Magpie infers a candidate TraceLens architecture from the benchmark
runner (for example, `mi355x` maps to `MI355X`) and asks the TraceLens
installation used for post-processing whether that platform is supported. It
passes `--gpu_arch_platform` only when the candidate appears in TraceLens'
`list_platforms()` result. This check runs with `TL_EXTENSION`, so platforms
provided by an extension wheel are included. If the platform is unavailable,
Magpie logs a warning and continues without architecture-specific roofline
data. An explicit `tracelens.gpu_arch_config` takes priority and is passed as
`--gpu_arch_json_path`.

For SGLang, TraceLens inference mode automatically adds
`--enable-profile-cuda-graph`. It also adds
`--enable-shape-discovery-for-cuda-graph-profile` when the configured Docker
image name looks like a TraceLens-patched SGLang image, such as
`tracelens-sglang:*` or `magpie-tracelens-sglang:*`. For local runs, Magpie also
detects whether the installed SGLang exposes the patched server argument. For
other SGLang builds, keep patched-runtime-only flags explicit in
`EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS`.

Each TraceLens inference postprocess command uses `cli_timeout_seconds`, which
defaults to `1800`. Increase it for long-output runs where splitting the full
decode trace can take longer:

```yaml
profiler:
  tracelens:
    enabled: true
    cli_timeout_seconds: 2400
```

To enable an internal TraceLens extension, set `TL_EXTENSION` either in the
shell environment or under benchmark envs. Magpie does not interpret the value;
it only passes the variable through to the benchmark and TraceLens
post-processing commands:

```yaml
benchmark:
  envs:
    TL_EXTENSION: "TraceLens_NDA"
```

### TraceLens output files

TraceLens writes results into the following directories under the benchmark workspace.

**Inference reports (`tracelens/`):**
- `prefilldecode/` - Mixed prefill+decode phase report
- `decode_only/` - Pure decode phase report
- `prefill_only/` - Pure prefill phase report
- `prefilldecode_ISL1024_OSL1024_CONC64_kernel_roofline_simple.csv` - Compact roofline summary for the mixed phase
- `decode_only_ISL1024_OSL1024_CONC64_kernel_roofline_simple.csv` - Compact roofline summary for decode
- `prefill_only_ISL1024_OSL1024_CONC64_kernel_roofline_simple.csv` - Compact roofline summary for prefill, when a prefill trace is available

TraceLens inference mode runs this post-processing flow:

1. Capture torch profiler traces during the benchmark run.
2. Split the rank-0 trace into representative inference phase windows under `torch_trace/trace_split/`.
3. Run TraceLens perf reports for the configured `analysis_stages`.
4. Write the full TraceLens CSV set into one subdirectory per stage.
5. Write one stage-level `*_ISL*_OSL*_CONC*_kernel_roofline_simple.csv` file in the `tracelens/` root.

The simple roofline files are intended as the first file to open when reviewing
TraceLens output. They keep the most useful roofline and timing columns from
`unified_perf_summary.csv` and add matched `param:*` metadata from the
category-specific TraceLens CSVs. The stage and benchmark `ISL`, `OSL`, and
`CONC` values are encoded in the filename, so the CSV itself does not include a
`stage` column.

Simple roofline columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `source_category` | TraceLens op category, such as `GEMM`, `MoE_unfused`, or `InferenceAttention` |
| `op_name` | Operation or pseudo-op name |
| `param_signature` | Human-readable parameter summary from category CSV `param:*` columns |
| `operation_count` | Number of operation instances aggregated into this row |
| `num_kernels` | Number of GPU kernels associated with the matched category row, when available |
| `kernel_time_ms_sum` | Total kernel time for the row, converted from microseconds to milliseconds |
| `time_pct` | Percent of total kernel time in the current stage |
| `kernel_time_us_mean` | Mean kernel time per operation instance, in microseconds |
| `gflops` | Estimated operation work in GFLOPs |
| `data_moved_mb` | Estimated data movement in MB |
| `arithmetic_intensity_flops_per_byte` | Arithmetic intensity, the roofline x-axis |
| `achieved_tflops_mean` | Mean achieved compute throughput in TFLOP/s |
| `achieved_tbps_mean` | Mean achieved memory bandwidth in TB/s |
| `compute_spec` | Compute capability/model used by TraceLens, for example `matrix_bf16` or `matrix_fp4` |
| `roofline_bound` | TraceLens roofline classification, such as `COMPUTE_BOUND` or `MEMORY_BOUND` |
| `pct_roofline_mean` | Mean percentage of the modeled roofline achieved |
| `roofline_time_us` | Modeled roofline time in microseconds |
| `has_perf_model` | Whether TraceLens had a performance model for the row |
| `params_json` | Machine-readable JSON copy of the matched params |
| `input_dims` | Input shapes recorded by TraceLens |
| `input_type` | Input dtypes/types recorded by TraceLens |

Sort the simple CSV by `kernel_time_ms_sum` or `time_pct` to find the dominant
operations first, then use `roofline_bound`, arithmetic intensity, achieved
TFLOP/s, achieved TB/s, and `pct_roofline_mean` to decide whether to investigate
compute efficiency, memory traffic, or missing performance-model coverage.

**Single-rank report (`tracelens_rank0_csvs/`):**
- `gpu_timeline.csv` - GPU kernel timeline
- `ops_summary.csv` - Operation summary
- `ops_summary_by_category.csv` - Operations by category
- `coll_analysis.csv` - Collective communication analysis
- `kernel_summary.csv` - Kernel summary statistics

**Multi-rank collective report (`tracelens_collective_csvs/`):**
- Aggregated statistics across all GPU ranks
- Communication pattern analysis
- Load balancing metrics

## Gap analysis

Gap analysis identifies GPU kernel bottlenecks from torch profiler traces. It applies a configurable time window to focus on the steady-state portion of the trace, then aggregates kernel durations by category.

The analysis pipeline runs the following steps.

1. Apply time window (`trace_start_pct` – `trace_end_pct`) to isolate steady-state events
2. Filter by category (case-insensitive substring matching on the event `cat` field)
3. Aggregate stats per kernel name, rank by total duration

**CSV output columns**: `Name, Calls, Self CUDA total (us), Avg time (us), % Total`

**Defaults (no YAML needed)**:
- `categories`: `["kernel", "gpu"]`
- `ignore_categories`: `["gpu_user_annotation"]`

**Minimal config**:
```yaml
  gap_analysis:
    enabled: true
    trace_start_pct: 50
    trace_end_pct: 80
```

### Standalone CLI

Run gap analysis on existing trace directories without re-running the benchmark.

```bash
# Basic usage (CLI defaults: --start-pct 0 --end-pct 100 unless you override)
python -m Magpie benchmark \
    --trace-dir results/benchmark_vllm_<timestamp>/

# With custom window and categories (align with YAML gap_analysis window if desired)
python -m Magpie benchmark \
    --trace-dir results/benchmark_vllm_<timestamp>/torch_trace \
    --start-pct 50 --end-pct 80 \
    --top-k 15 \
    --categories kernel gpu \
    --ignore-categories gpu_user_annotation
```

The `--trace-dir` argument accepts either a benchmark workspace directory (auto-detects `torch_trace/` inside) or a direct path to the trace directory.

Output is written to a `gap_analysis/` subfolder under the trace directory's parent.
