# Analyze and compare kernels with Magpie

Magpie’s Analyze and Compare modes both evaluate GPU kernels—HIP, CUDA, PyTorch, and Triton—through the same underlying pipeline: optional compilation, correctness validation against a testcase, and optional performance profiling. 

Analyze targets a single kernel and produces a detailed per-stage evaluation report, making it the right choice when you need to confirm that one implementation is correct before promoting it. 

Compare targets two or more kernel variants, runs the same evaluation pipeline on each, and produces a ranked result with a declared winner, making it the right choice when you want to find the fastest correct implementation from a set of candidates.

## Mode comparison

This table summarizes the key differences between the two modes:

| | **Analyze** | **Compare** |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Validate one implementation end-to-end | Rank two or more implementations |
| **Kernels** | One (or multiple independent runs from one config) | At least two |
| **Testcase** | **Required** (CLI or YAML `testcase_command`) | Optional per kernel; if omitted, PyTorch can use **result comparison** mode between variants (runs each variant with identical seeded inputs and checks for NaN/Inf) |
| **Outcome** | Per-kernel `EvaluationState` | `ComparisonResult`: correctness vector, perf scores, rankings, `winner` |
| **CLI** | `magpie analyze …` | `magpie compare …` |
| **Report file** | `analyze_report.json` | `compare_report.json` |

For the benchmark pipeline architecture, see [Magpie benchmarking mode architecture](../conceptual/benchmarking-architecture.md). An analyze/compare pipeline diagram is available in the [repository README](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Magpie#readme).

### When to use which

- **Analyze** when you have a single kernel (or a small set you want to evaluate independently) and a clear test command (build + run test, or script that exits non-zero on failure).
- **Compare** when you have multiple source variants (for example, v1 vs v2 HIP, or several PyTorch implementations) and want Magpie to run them in sequence, check correctness, optionally profile each, and produce a ranking and winner using configured scoring rules.

## Correctness behavior

The two modes differ in how they validate kernel output.

### Analyze

- `AnalyzeMode` requires `testcase_command` in the effective `KernelEvalConfig`. Without it, analysis stops with an error.
- Use this mode when your validation story is “run this command and trust exit status or Accordo backend output.”

### Compare

- If a kernel has `testcase_command`, correctness uses the `testcase` path (same idea as analyze).
- If *no* testcase is provided, compare can use **result comparison** mode for PyTorch-style workflows: each variant is run with identical randomly seeded inputs, and the outputs are checked for NaN and Inf. A variant passes correctness if its output is finite on every iteration; the `compare_report.json` `correctness` vector records `true` or `false` per variant. Note that this mode does not numerically compare variants against each other—it validates each independently. For cross-variant numerical validation, provide a `testcase_command` that asserts expected values.
- You need *at least two* kernel entries (from CLI paths or YAML `kernels:` list).

## CLI quick reference

The following examples show the most common analyze and compare invocations:

```bash
# Analyze: kernel file(s) + testcase (required without --kernel-config)
magpie analyze path/to/kernel.hip -t "./run_test.sh"

# Analyze from YAML (kernel: or kernels:: analyze still needs testcase per entry)
magpie analyze --kernel-config Magpie/kernel_config.yaml.example

# Compare: at least two kernels
magpie compare kernel_a.hip kernel_b.hip

# Optional shared testcase on CLI (applied when using positional kernel files)
magpie compare k1.hip k2.hip -t "./run_both.sh"

# Compare from YAML (e.g. examples/ck_grouped_gemm_compare.yaml)
magpie compare --kernel-config examples/ck_grouped_gemm_compare.yaml

# Skip profiling (both modes)
magpie analyze ... --no-perf
magpie compare ... --no-perf

# Baseline index for compare (YAML / framework config still controls winner strategy)
magpie compare k0.hip k1.hip --baseline 0
```

Kernel types: `--type` accepts `hip`, `cuda`, `pytorch`, `triton`.

## YAML configuration

Shared rules:

- **`kernel:`**: single kernel block.
- **`kernels:`**: list of kernel blocks (typical for compare).
- Optional sections in the same file: `performance`, `correctness`, `scheduler`, `ray_config` (see `load_kernel_config` in `Magpie/main.py`).

Examples in-repo:

| Mode | Example file |
|------|----------------|
| Analyze | `examples/ck_gemm_add.yaml`, `examples/simple_hip_test/analyze_default.yaml` |
| Compare | `examples/ck_grouped_gemm_compare.yaml` |

## Framework config (`Magpie/config.yaml`)

Both modes read **GPU**, **scheduler**, **compiling**, **performance**, and **correctness** settings.

**Compare-only** (`compare:`):

- **`perf_weights_rocprof` / `perf_weights_ncu` / `perf_weights_metrix`**: weights used when turning profiler summaries into scalar **perf scores**.
- **`perf_lower_is_better`**: metric names where lower values score better (defaults include duration-style metrics).
- **`winner_strategy`** (passed through from config to `CompareConfig`): typically `perf_score` (highest score wins among ranked kernels) or `correctness_first` (first kernel that passes correctness). Default in code is `perf_score`.

Tune these when your comparison should emphasize different hardware metrics or when correctness should override raw performance.

## Workspace output

Analyze and compare runs create timestamped workspaces under `--output-dir` (default `./results`):

- **Analyze**: `analyze_report.json` plus profiler output under `performance/` when profiling is enabled; config snapshot and correctness artifacts as configured.
- **Compare**: `compare_report.json` with `kernel_results`, `comparison_metrics` (including `correctness`, `perf_scores`, `all_correct`), `rankings`, `winner`, and `summary`.
