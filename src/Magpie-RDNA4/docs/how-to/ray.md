# Run Magpie on a Ray cluster

Ray integration lets you offload Magpie's analyze, compare, and benchmark workloads to remote GPU nodes without changing the evaluation logic—the same `AnalyzeMode`, `CompareMode`, and `BenchmarkMode` code runs on the worker as it would run locally, driven by a `RayJobExecutor` that the driver submits to the cluster. This is useful when the GPUs, software stack, or model weights you need are on a dedicated cluster node rather than the machine running the CLI or MCP server. This page covers how to configure the cluster connection, set up shared storage, run kernel and benchmark workloads on Ray, and troubleshoot common problems.

---

## Goals and scope

- **Offload** compilation, correctness checks, profilers, and LLM serving to machines that actually have the GPUs and software stack you need.
- **Reuse the same mode code** (`AnalyzeMode`, `CompareMode`, `BenchmarkMode`) on the worker; Ray only changes how the task is launched (`RayJobExecutor` + `run_task` on a worker).
- **Rely on shared storage** (typically NFS) so Hugging Face caches, InferenceX checkouts, and benchmark artifacts are visible to both driver and workers.

Ray integration does not require the Ray Dashboard or Jobs API—only connectivity to the cluster (`ray.init` with `auto` or `ray://…`).

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|--------|
| Python `ray` package on the driver | `pip install ray`; same major version as the cluster is recommended. |
| GPU worker nodes registered with Ray | Nodes expose `GPU` resources in `ray.nodes()`. |
| Magpie importable on workers | Default `RayConfig.install_magpie` is `true`: workers can install Magpie + `requirements.txt` using Ray `runtime_env["pip"]`. Optional extras such as `.[intellikit]` are not installed this way; add those packages to `pip_packages` or pre-install them in the image. Set `install_magpie: false` to skip runtime installation. |
| Shared filesystem (strongly recommended) | Same mount path on driver and workers for model cache, InferenceX, and benchmark results. |
| Kernel / project paths (analyze and compare) | Paths in YAML (for example, `${CK_HOME}/…`) must exist on the worker (or on shared FS visible there). |

---

## Connect to the cluster (`cluster_address`)

`RayConfig.cluster_address` (and the analyze/compare path: values taken from kernel YAML `ray_config.cluster_address` into `SchedulerConfig.ray_cluster_address`) is passed to `ray.init(address=…)`.

| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `"auto"` | Driver runs on the Ray head or in the same Ray network namespace so the local GCS is discoverable. |
| IP/hostname of head (for example, `"192.168.1.10:6379"`) | Explicit GCS address when `auto` is ambiguous. |
| `"ray://<host>:10001"` | Driver is remote; connect using Ray Client (typical client port `10001`). |

Using `auto` from a laptop that is not attached to the cluster will not reach remote workers—use `ray://…` or run the driver on the head node.

---

## Shared storage

Default shared root in code: `DEFAULT_SHARED_STORAGE_PATH = "/shared_nfs/magpie"` (`Magpie/modes/benchmark/config.py`). Override with `shared_storage_path` in YAML.

### What uses it

- **Worker env** (`Magpie/remote/tasks.py` `_setup_env`): sets `HF_HOME` and `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` under `{shared_storage_path}/hf_cache` unless already set.
- **Benchmark on Ray** (`_run_benchmark`): if paths are empty, sets `inferencex_path` → `{shared_storage}/InferenceX`, `hf_cache_path` → `{shared_storage}/hf_cache`, and writes results under `{results_dir}/{task_id}` (defaults `results_dir` to `{shared_storage}/results`).

Analyze/compare do not rewrite kernel `working_dir` for you: your YAML must point at directories the worker can access (local disk or the same NFS mount).

### Driver `runtime_env` and cache dirs

`RayJobExecutor._build_runtime_env` sets `HF_HOME` / `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` from `RayConfig.hf_cache_dir` (derived from `shared_storage_path`) for the remote task environment, and optionally adds `pip` entries when `install_magpie` or `pip_packages` is set.

---

## Analyze and compare on Ray

The following sections describe how to configure and run kernel analyze and compare workloads on a Ray cluster.

### Enable Ray for kernel modes

1. Add a top-level `ray_config:` block to the kernel YAML. `load_kernel_config` in `Magpie/main.py` sets `scheduler.environment` to `ray` when `ray_config` is present (unless overridden).
2. Or set `scheduler.environment: ray` in framework `config.yaml` / kernel YAML `scheduler:` and supply connection details (see below).

### Fields read from kernel YAML into the scheduler

`_get_scheduler_config` maps:

- `ray_config.cluster_address` → `SchedulerConfig.ray_cluster_address`
- `ray_config.shared_storage_path` → `SchedulerConfig.ray_shared_storage_path`

The scheduler then constructs a `RayConfig` for `RayJobExecutor` with those fields (and defaults for all other `RayConfig` attributes such as `install_magpie`, `entrypoint_num_cpus`, `pip_packages`). Extra keys under kernel YAML `ray_config` are not merged into that executor `RayConfig` in the current implementation—treat comments in examples as hints for future alignment or for benchmark YAML where merging differs.

### Override environment on the CLI

For any kernel config that implies Ray, you can force local execution:

```bash
python -m Magpie analyze --kernel-config examples/ck_gemm_add_ray.yaml -e local
```

Priority is CLI `--environment` > kernel YAML > `Magpie/config.yaml` scheduler (`Magpie/main.py` `_get_scheduler_config`).

### Remote execution path

1. `run_analyze` / `run_compare` builds kernel configs and calls `scheduler.run_analyze` / `run_compare`.
2. `Scheduler` creates a `Task` with `ModeType.ANALYZE` or `COMPARE` and `executor.execute(task)`.
3. `RayJobExecutor._submit_ray_task` serializes `task.to_dict()` into `job_payload`, merges benchmark-only `ray_config` overrides if present (usually empty for kernel tasks), and calls `run_task.remote(job_payload)`.
4. On the worker, `run_task` runs `_run_analyze` or `_run_compare` (`Magpie/remote/tasks.py`)—same classes as locally.

Result shape: the driver receives a dict; `main.run_analyze` unwraps nested `results` when Ray returns `{"task_id", "results": [...]}`.

### Example

See `examples/ck_gemm_add_ray.yaml`: `ray_config.cluster_address`, `shared_storage_path`, plus kernel paths using `${CK_HOME}` on the worker.

```bash
python -m Magpie analyze --kernel-config examples/ck_gemm_add_ray.yaml --no-perf
```

---

## Benchmark on Ray

The following sections describe how to configure and run framework-level benchmarks on a Ray cluster.

### Configuration

In benchmark YAML set:

```yaml
benchmark:
  run_mode: ray
  ray_config:
    cluster_address: "auto"          # or ray://head:10001
    shared_storage_path: "/shared_nfs/magpie"
    entrypoint_num_cpus: 32
    install_magpie: false              # common when image already has Magpie
```

Full `RayConfig` fields are documented in `Magpie/modes/benchmark/config.py`. For `BenchmarkConfig`, `ray_config` is required when `run_mode` is `ray`.

### Worker-side behavior

`_run_benchmark` (`Magpie/remote/tasks.py`):

1. Sets `run_mode` from `ray` to `local` so the worker runs `BenchmarkMode` on that node (Docker or local subprocess), not another Ray hop.
2. Fills default `inferencex_path` / `hf_cache_path` from `shared_storage_path` when omitted.
3. Sets `output_dir` to `{results_dir}/{task_id}` (defaults under shared storage).

The driver does not run vLLM/SGLang; it waits on `ray.get` and maps the returned dict into `BenchmarkResult` (`benchmarker._populate_result_from_ray`).

### Tensor parallelism and multi-node hints

For benchmark payloads only, `run_task` calls `_configure_tp_isolation`:

- If `TP` ≤ GPUs on the current Ray node, it clears `RAY_ADDRESS` in the worker env and can append vLLM `--distributed-executor-backend mp` so the child uses local multiprocessing.
- If `TP` exceeds local GPUs, it keeps `RAY_ADDRESS` and can append vLLM `--distributed-executor-backend ray` or SGLang `--use-ray --nnodes N`.

Logic is in `Magpie/remote/tasks.py` (`_get_local_gpu_count`, `_configure_tp_isolation`). Tune `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` / `EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS` in YAML if you need overrides.

### Entry points on the driver

| Entry | Location | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| CLI / MCP `benchmark` with YAML `run_mode: ray` | `BenchmarkMode.run()` | Creates `RayJobExecutor`, `execute(task)`, fills `BenchmarkResult`. |
| `Scheduler.run_benchmark_ray(...)` | `Magpie/core/scheduler.py` | Injects `run_mode: ray` and minimal `ray_config`, then `BenchmarkMode.run()` (same core path; helper for programmatic use). |

### Example YAML

`examples/benchmarks/benchmark_vllm_dsr1_ray.yaml` shows a full vLLM benchmark targeting Ray with shared storage and `install_magpie: false`.

## Scheduling, GPUs, and the outer `num_gpus=0` task

`RayJobExecutor._submit_ray_task` declares the remote function with `num_gpus=0` but pins it to a node that has GPUs using `NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy` (`ray.util.scheduling_strategies`). `RayJobExecutor._find_gpu_node` prefers a non-head GPU worker when possible.

Why `num_gpus=0`? Frameworks such as vLLM might spawn their own Ray or multiprocessing workers and need to control `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Reserving all GPUs on the outer task would conflict with that model.

After the task starts, `_clear_hidden_gpus` removes Ray-imposed empty visibility env vars so child processes see the node GPUs again (`Magpie/remote/tasks.py`).

```{note}
`gpu_selection` is disabled under Ray. The benchmark YAML's
`gpu_selection` block (auto idle-GPU picker) is a no-op when
`run_mode: ray`: Ray schedules devices itself using `num_gpus`, and a
driver-side `rocm-smi` or `nvidia-smi` scan does not reflect worker nodes.
To restrict the cluster to specific cards, export
`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` in the shell before
starting `ray start` on each node.
```

---

## Asynchronous benchmark submit (MCP and advanced)

`BenchmarkMode.submit_ray_benchmark(executor)` submits a Ray task without blocking; MCP and scripts can poll with the same `RayJobExecutor` instance. Related MCP tools (see `Magpie/mcp/server.py`):

- `ray_task_status`: running / succeeded / failed
- `ray_task_result`: cached result dict after completion
- `ray_task_cancel`: cancel an object ref
- `ray_task_list`: tracked task IDs

---

## `RayConfig` reference

Defined in `Magpie/modes/benchmark/config.py` (`@dataclass RayConfig`).

| Field | Role |
|-------|------|
| `cluster_address` | `ray.init(address=…)` |
| `shared_storage_path` | Root for HF cache, InferenceX, results layout on workers |
| `entrypoint_num_cpus` | CPUs requested on the outer remote task |
| `entrypoint_num_gpus` | Declared on `RayConfig` but outer task uses `num_gpus=0` in code |
| `multi_node`, `total_num_gpus`, `num_nodes`, `gpus_per_node` | Used when building `runtime_env` (`RAY_ADDRESS`, `MAGPIE_TOTAL_GPUS`) for multi-node scenarios |
| `pip_packages` | Extra pip specs in `runtime_env` |
| `env_vars` | Extra env for remote task |
| `install_magpie` | If true, adds Magpie project + `requirements.txt` lines to `runtime_env["pip"]`; optional extras must be supplied through `pip_packages` or a prebuilt worker image |
| `magpie_install_path` | Override root used for editable Magpie install |

Derived helpers: `results_dir`, `hf_cache_dir`, `inferencex_dir`.
