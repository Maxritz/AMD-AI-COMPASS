# Magpie compatibility matrix

This topic lists the known version requirements for Magpie. It covers hardware
and software requirements and captures only versions that have been verified and
tested.

| GPU                              | ROCm                       | Python    | Ubuntu       | PyYAML | NumPy     | MCP      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| MI300X,<br>MI325X,<br>MI355X | 7.0.x,<br>7.1.x,<br>7.2.x | 3.10–3.13 | 22.04, 24.04 | >= 6.0 | >= 1.24.0 | >= 1.0.0 |

- GPUs are verified using the bundled benchmark scripts in `Magpie/scripts/benchmark/`.
- Python versions are declared in `pyproject.toml`; the minimum is 3.10.
- MCP (`mcp`) is required only for the MCP server.
- IntelliKit integrations are optional (pinned commit `3f45cd314d455b652a1246678511b40547fe521e`). 

## Profilers and optional tools

The following profiling tools and optional packages extend Magpie's capabilities.

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rocprof-compute` | >= 3.2.3 | AMD performance profiling. See the [install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/install/core-install.html). |
| IntelliKit Metrix | `3f45cd314d455b652a1246678511b40547fe521e` | Optional AMD profiling integration. Install with `.[metrix]` or `.[intellikit]`. |
| IntelliKit Accordo | `3f45cd314d455b652a1246678511b40547fe521e` | Optional AMD correctness integration. Install with `.[accordo]` or `.[intellikit]`. |

```{note}
The IntelliKit integrations (Accordo and Metrix) are optional/experimental. Magpie primarily relies on ROCm libraries.
```

## Framework benchmark compatibility

Benchmark mode runs against external inference frameworks with the following
supported model precisions.

| Framework | Supported precisions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vLLM | fp8, fp16, bf16, fp4 | Default precision is fp8. |
| SGLang | fp8, fp16, bf16, fp4 | |
| Atom | fp8, fp16, bf16, fp4 | Single-node v1. |
