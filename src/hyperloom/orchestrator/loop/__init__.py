"""Coordinator reactor loop: facade + extracted collaborator objects.

``coordinator.py`` holds the thin facade (``__init__``/``tick``/``run``/
``_reactor_pass`` + lazy collaborator properties); the method clusters it
delegates to live in the sibling modules here (``conversation``,
``maintenance``, ``dispatcher``, ``proposals``, ``writeback``,
``intent_router``, ``build_lifecycle``). ``writeback`` also owns the folded
result-recording and resume-reconcile clusters; ``dispatcher`` owns the folded
gating and inline action clusters; ``conversation`` owns the folded advisory
blocks; ``build_lifecycle`` owns the off-loop targeted-build
enqueue/pump/reap cluster.
