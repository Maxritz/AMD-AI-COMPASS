"""SQLite-backed GPU pool for specialist sub-agents.

Separate from the serving lanes: constrains specialists that request
``needs_gpu=true`` for wall-budgeted on-GPU work (servers on non-8888 ports,
profiling, autotune, and real benchmark loops on their leased cards).

Ray-managed GPU execution (gated by
:func:`hyperloom.orchestrator.actions.executors._ray_backend.ray_gpu_specialist_exec_enabled`):
under single-node Ray execution the **physical** card assignment for a ``needs_gpu``
specialist is Ray's — the specialist subprocess runs inside a
``GpuSpecialistActor(num_gpus=…)`` that Ray masks to its assigned devices. This
pool is then only **capacity / TTL accounting**: ``try_acquire`` still gates
concurrency and records a lease (so the wall-budget / TTL views, prompt display,
and the existing dispatch tests keep working), but the ``GpuLease.gpu_ids`` it
returns are no longer the physical device pins (the dispatcher advertises the
logical ``0..N-1`` view Ray exposes instead). Off the Ray path (multi-node /
``INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAY_EXEC`` off / tests) the ids remain the device pins.

       specialist-only set here, so it is trusted verbatim and the serving
       cards are *not* subtracted again.
    2. The process visible-device mask (``ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES``, then
       ``HIP``/``CUDA``), serving cards carved off the front, capped to
       ``capacity``. The leased ids are written verbatim into each specialist

    and production serving (shared cards = garbage numbers for both), so they
    are subtracted from the resolvable pool. ``serving_tp=0`` (the default)
    preserves the legacy whole-pool behaviour.

    Capacity zero disables dispatch.
