"""DB retention / pruning for multi-day single-session runs.

The ``events`` and ``tasks`` tables are otherwise append-only and would grow
without bound over a multi-day run (no process restart clears them). These
helpers bound them while preserving the two correctness invariants:

* **Resume safety** — ``events`` are replayed at resume via
  :meth:`MessageBus.replay_for(after_seq=cursor)`. An event is only deletable
  once *every* agent cursor has advanced past it (``seq <= min(cursor)``) AND it
  falls outside a recent-window margin (so ``lookup_by_id`` of a fresh
  ``in_reply_to`` still resolves). The prune watermark is therefore
  ``min(min_processed_seq, max_seq - keep_recent)`` — strictly below the resume
  anchor.
* **In-flight safety** — ``tasks`` pruning never touches ``queued`` / ``running``
  / ``failed`` rows; only truly-done (``succeeded`` / ``cancelled``) rows beyond
  a keep-recent count are removed.
