"""Thin leaf sub-agent definition for single-layer specialist fan-out.

A specialist may ``Task(subagent_type="hyperloom-leaf")`` to parallelize a
focused, single-shot sub-task. The leaf has bash + read tools but no ``Task``,
so fan-out depth is fixed at one. Leaves run inside the specialist subprocess
and inherit its ``VISIBLE_DEVICES``, sharing the parent's GPU lease.
