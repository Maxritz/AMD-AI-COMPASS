"""Specialist sub-agent domain catalogue.

LLM sub-agent form factor parameterized by a ``domain`` — a stable
id used across dispatch and prompt assembly. A runtime constant, not
per-domain yaml.

Field reference:

* ``key`` — canonical id used in ``delegate{params.domain}``.
* ``layer`` — short human label (analysis layer covered).
* ``kb_anchor`` — knowledge-domain label for prompt grouping.
* ``available_in`` — ``"M5"`` / ``"M6"``; both are dispatchable.

All specialists share the global :data:`PR_QUERY_REPOS` allowlist and query
the PR Monitor directly via ``mcp__pr_monitor__*`` tools.
