"""Seed checklist for the static-recon specialist.

The static-recon specialist is a read-only PRELUDE sub-agent that greps the
framework source tree (vLLM / SGLang) for *un-bridged capability switches* —
fast paths that *should* be enabled for the current ``(model_class, gpu_type,
precision)`` but are silently disabled by a predicate (e.g. a CUDA-only
``*_supported()`` helper returning ``False`` on ROCm). This module seeds the
specialist with a curated list of known patterns to look for.

Each :class:`ChecklistEntry` describes one known "bridge opportunity":
- ``id`` — stable slug, used to build the gap canonical id.
- ``applies_when`` — coarse predicate over ``{gpu, precision}`` (``"*"`` = any)
  so an entry is only handed to a run where it could plausibly fire.
- ``detect`` — what to grep for and how to confirm the path is disabled.
- ``consequence`` — what regression the disabled path causes.
- ``bridge`` — advisory sketch of the fix.
- ``domain_hint`` — which EXPLORE specialist domain should pick up the gap.
- ``evidence`` — provenance (PR / session) the pattern was distilled from.

A small, hand-curated starter set keyed to validated findings.
