"""Deterministic trajectory review — synthesise candidate directions from the
whole optimization lineage when the search stalls.

Reads the optimization journal, the ``explore_search`` winners history, and the
roofline snapshots on :class:`SharedState`, then renders an advisory block
naming exhausted directions to avoid and an under-exploited bottleneck to push.
Read-only and fail-soft; never raises and never gates phase advance.
