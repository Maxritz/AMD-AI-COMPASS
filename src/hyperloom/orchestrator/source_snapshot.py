"""Durable, per-KEEP snapshot of the framework *source layer*.

Every KEEP snapshots its *realized* file contents into a session-scoped,
self-contained directory that no later git hygiene can touch, rather than
treating the mutable live tree as the source of truth.

The on-disk format is the cross-tool contract (Hyperloom writes it; the GEAK
side re-implements the same trivial reader), so neither side needs to import
the other::

    <snapshot_dir>/manifest.json   # {framework_root, base_sha, files:[{rel,op}]}
    <snapshot_dir>/files/<rel>     # full copy of each realized file

Full-file capture (not a fuzzy diff) reconstructs byte-for-byte regardless of
patch strip levels, generated/untracked files, or whether the framework root
is a git tree at all.
