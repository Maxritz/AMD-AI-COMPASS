Public (open-source) TraceLens does not carry MAF values; those live only in
TraceLens-internal. When TraceLens-internal is not enabled we
run the TraceLens GPU microbenchmark suite to produce a measured arch spec
(``TraceLens/Agent/Analysis/utils/arch/<platform>.json``); when it is enabled it
backfills MAF itself and the microbenchmark is skipped. The benchmark selects an
unoccupied GPU and pins the visible-device vars only on the microbenchmark
subprocess, running with ``--warmup 20 --rep 50``.
