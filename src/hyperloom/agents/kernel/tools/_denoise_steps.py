"""Shared helpers for the diffusion per-denoise-step roofline divisor.

The workload-level ``diffusion_roofline.json`` reports per-denoise-step timings
as ``workload_totals / num_denoise_steps``. The divisor MUST be the number of
denoise steps ACTUALLY IN the analyzed data (the steady-state window for bypass,
or the profiled iterations in the trace for the TraceLens route), NOT the
requested full sampler schedule -- otherwise the per-step figure is off by the
ratio of scheduled-to-profiled steps and is not comparable across routes.

Kept dependency-free (stdlib only) so both routes can import it freely.
