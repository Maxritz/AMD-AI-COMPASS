"""Local payload-schema check mirroring upstream ``PolicyGate.validate_intent``.

PolicyGate is the server-side source of truth (rejects with ``PolicyDenied``
+ a ``policy_denied`` inbox observation), but that costs ≥1 silent tick.
:class:`PolicyAware` runs the same checks locally and raises
:class:`PolicyViolation` so unit tests catch schema drift immediately. The
mirrored schema is a subset limited to robustness-emittable intents.

The per-intent rules are not re-listed here: this module only orders the three
gate stages (role -> required fields -> per-intent) and dispatches the last one
through the single ``role.envelope.INTENT_SPEC`` table. ``PolicyViolation`` and
the validators live next to the intent contract in ``role.envelope``;
``tests/test_role_contract.py`` cross-checks that table against the upstream one.
