"""Progress-stagnation detectors (B2 / B3).

Two stateful rules: ``gain_plateau`` (validated gain flat within
``epsilon_pct`` across ``window_ticks`` while still proposing actions →
suggest ``report``) and ``no_levers_found`` (after
``min_observation_minutes`` the optimization_stack is empty and validated
gain still 0). Both short-circuit in ``closing_phase`` or once a
``stop_reason`` is set.
