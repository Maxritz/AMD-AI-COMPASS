# Primus Cortex endpoints used by framework-agent

> Technical reference for the five primus_cortex REST
> endpoints that `hyperloom.agents.framework.sources.primus_cortex` talks to.
> This file is the authoritative contract from framework-agent's point of view.

## Base URL

```
https://your-pr-monitor.example
```

The base URL is deployment-specific (no host is hardcoded). It is wired
into `ExploreRequest.primus_cortex.base_url` or the `PRIMUS_CORTEX_PR_API`
env var. The framework-agent client trims a trailing slash before
composing paths.

`GET /v1/healthz` returns `{"status": "ok"}` and is the recommended
liveness probe before kicking off a run.

## Endpoints

### `GET /v1/search/prs`

The primary discovery path whenever keywords are present; the `/prs` list
endpoint below is only its fallback.

Query params:

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | str | Space-joined keywords; the server does word-**AND** matching, so a long query can return zero rows. |
| `repo` | str | `owner/name` slug. |
| `state` | `"open"` / `"all"` | `"all"` when `ExploreRequest.pr_states` includes merged/closed/all, else `"open"`. |
| `limit` | int | Over-fetched at `3 x max_search_candidates`; the client then reranks by `score_title_with_anti_signal` and trims to `max_search_candidates`. |

Response (200): the same list shapes as `/prs`, except items may be match
records `{"summary": {...pr fields...}, "matched_field": ..., "snippet": ...}`.
`_coerce_pr_item` unwraps `summary` to the list endpoint's payload shape.

Errors: the dispatcher falls back to `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/prs`
(label-only listing) in two cases — a `PrimusCortexError` (e.g. a server that
does not implement this endpoint) and an empty result set. This is the one
place framework-agent deliberately catches `PrimusCortexError` instead of
hard-failing; see the "Do not catch-and-fallback silently" rule under
"Error semantics".

### `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/prs`

Query params:

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | `"open"` / `"closed"` / `"all"` | Default `"open"` in framework-agent. |
| `limit` | int | Capped by `ExploreRequest.max_search_candidates`. |
| `label` | str | Optional; passes through to the server's label filter. |

Response (200): either a flat list or a dict wrapping a list under one
of `items` / `prs` / `data` / `results`. framework-agent tolerates
both shapes via `_extract_pr_list`.

Each item is coerced to a `GitHubPr(number, title, html_url)` record.
`html_url` may be served from `url` instead.

Errors: HTTP 4xx/5xx, transport, or non-JSON body all surface as
`PrimusCortexError` (hard-fail).

### `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/prs/{number}`

Returns the PR detail object. Two wire shapes are supported:

* PR Monitor canonical: `{"summary": {...}, "body": "...",
  "files": [...]}`. `summary.head_sha` / `summary.author_login` /
  `summary.labels` carry the metadata framework-agent enriches with.
* GitHub-like flat: `{"number": ..., "head": {"sha": ...}, ...}`. The
  `_extract_*` helpers in `explorer.py` fall through both shapes.

Hard-fail if the body is not a JSON object.

### `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/prs/{number}/files`

Returns the file list. Wire shape: either a flat JSON array, or a
dict wrapping a list under `files` / `items` / `data`. Each item
should expose at least `file_path` (preferred) or `filename` /
`path`. Additional fields (`additions`, `deletions`, `status`,
`blob_sha`, ...) are passed through to `pr_files.json` verbatim
without interpretation.

Hard-fail on unrecognised wire shape.

### `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/prs/{number}/patches`

Returns a **JSON array** of per-file patch objects (despite the
endpoint name's "patches" implying raw text):

```jsonc
[
  {
    "file": {
      "file_path": "python/x/foo.py",
      "previous_path": null,
      "status": "modified" | "added" | "deleted" | "renamed",
      ...
    },
    "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@\n-a\n+b\n c",
    "patch_truncated": false
  }
]
```

framework-agent renders this into a unified-diff stream that
`git apply` can consume. The synthesized header for each entry is:

```
diff --git a/<old_path> b/<new_path>
--- <a/old_path | /dev/null>
+++ <b/new_path | /dev/null>
<patch body>
```

`status="added"` -> old side is `/dev/null`; `status="deleted"` /
`"removed"` -> new side is `/dev/null`. Renamed files use
`previous_path` for the old side. Items missing the `patch` field
(e.g. binary diffs) emit only the diff header and skip the hunk
body.

Wire-shape fallbacks: a dict wrapping the list under `patches` /
`items` / `data` is tolerated; a bare string body is returned
verbatim (legacy server).

Hard-fail on unrecognised wire shape.

## Error semantics

The `PrimusCortexError` class wraps all failure cases:

| Cause | Message shape |
|---|---|
| HTTP 4xx/5xx | `primus_cortex HTTP <code> at <url>: <body[:512]>` |
| URL unreachable (DNS / no route) | `primus_cortex unreachable at <url>: <reason>` |
| Transport timeout / OSError | `primus_cortex transport error at <url>: <exc>` |
| Non-JSON body | `primus_cortex returned non-JSON at <url>: ...` |
| Malformed JSON shape | `primus_cortex response at <url> ...` |

Callers should let `PrimusCortexError` propagate; the CLI's outer
`except Exception` translates it into exit code 2 with the original
message preserved on stderr. **Do not catch-and-fallback silently**;
the operator must see the original error.

## Notes

* HTTP requests are made via stdlib `urllib.request` (no `requests`
  dependency). The User-Agent is `framework-agent-primus-cortex/0.1`.
* All requests are GET; framework-agent never POSTs to the PR Monitor service.
* If no primus_cortex service is available, omit `primus_cortex` from
  `search_modes` and rely on the GitHub backend.
