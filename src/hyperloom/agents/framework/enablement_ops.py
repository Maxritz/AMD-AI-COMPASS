"""Enablement discovery + authoring operations.

Two halves of the enablement flow that both build on a
:class:`.enablement.FailureSignature`:

* **Discovery** — given a failure signature, decide which repos to scout for an
  enabling PR (the serving framework plus the ROCm / HIP / aiter bridge repos)
  and rank candidate PR titles by enablement intent ("enable / support / add /
  fix / port to ROCm"). See :func:`build_search_plan`, :func:`rank_titles`,
  :func:`score_enablement_title`.
* **Authoring** — turn a request + ranked candidates into the
  :class:`EnablementMandate` (allowed source roots + task description + patch
  invariants) handed to the patch-authoring specialist. See
  :func:`build_mandate`.

Pure-Python and GPU-free: no network or LLM access. :func:`build_mandate` reads
the local filesystem (source-root probe + installed package version) unless
``root_hints`` is passed explicitly.
