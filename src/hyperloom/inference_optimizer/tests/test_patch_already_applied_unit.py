"""Already-applied patches must be a satisfied no-op, not an apply failure.

A specialist commonly writes both a superset patch and the subset it contains
(e.g. an FLA state-layout revert, plus that same revert bundled with a config
fix). Whichever lands first makes the other's hunks a no-op, and both POSIX
``patch`` and ``git apply --check`` reject that with a non-zero exit that looks
exactly like "does not apply". Treating it as a hard failure aborted the whole
enablement combo and reverted a correctly-applied fix.

Both apply channels resolve the ambiguity with a *reverse* dry-run, which
succeeds only when every hunk's post-state is already present. These tests pin
the three outcomes that matter: no-op on full overlap, real failure on no
overlap, and real failure on *partial* overlap (where a no-op would be wrong).
