"""Exit-code mapping for terminal stop_reasons.

Regression: a clean no-kernel run closes with stop_reason ``conc_sweep_done``
(and a shape-grid run with ``sweep_done``). Both mean the optimizer ran and
closed normally, yet the CLI used to return exit code 1 for them, so CI (with
backoffLimit: 0) flagged a successful run as failed.
