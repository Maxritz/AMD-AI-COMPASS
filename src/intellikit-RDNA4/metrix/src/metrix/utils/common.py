    Split counters into multiple profiling passes based on per-block limits.

    This is a generic bin-packing helper used by architecture-specific
    backends. Hardware-specific information (block names and limits) must
    be provided by the caller.

    Args:
        counters:
            List of hardware counter names to collect.
        block_limits:
            Optional mapping block_name -> max_counters_per_pass.
            If omitted or empty, falls back to simple chunking by `max_per_pass`.
        get_counter_block:
            Optional function mapping counter_name -> block_name.
            Required when `block_limits` is provided.
        max_per_pass:
            Maximum counters per pass for the simple chunking fallback.
        default_block_limit:
            Fallback per-block limit used when a block name is missing
            from `block_limits`.
        logger:
            Optional logger with .info / .debug methods.

    Returns:
        List of counter lists, one per profiling pass.
