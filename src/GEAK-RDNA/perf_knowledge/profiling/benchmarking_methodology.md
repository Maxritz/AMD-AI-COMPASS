# Benchmarking methodology on MI GPUs

## TL;DR
A trustworthy MI-GPU measurement is: **warm** (discard cold runs), **repeated** (median of ≥3; the
perf_knowledge e2e standard is **REPEATS=7**), inside a **noise band** (accept a change only if it clears the
**~0.5%** e2e band), with **clocks controlled** (or at least monitored), and done as a **same-session,
non-overlapping A/B** (ref vs candidate back-to-back). If the delta is inside the noise band, it is not
a result. Profiling perturbs timing, so measure in a *separate, untraced* pass from your counter/trace
diagnosis ([`trace_analysis.md`](trace_analysis.md), [`rocprofv3_counters.md`](rocprofv3_counters.md)).

## Why MI300X is noisy (what you're fighting)
- **Peak ≠ sustained clock.** 2.1 GHz is a boost ceiling; under sustained load the engine clock settles
  lower and is power/thermal-capped ([`../hardware/cdna3_mi300/clocks_power.md`](../hardware/cdna3_mi300/clocks_power.md)).
- **Per-XCD clock variance 3–10%** across the 8 XCDs — different launches hit different clocks.
- **DVFS ramp lag** — a short kernel can finish before the clock ramps; warmup hides this.
Net: compute achieved TFLOP/s from *measured time*, never from assumed clock.

## The recipe
1. **Warmup.** Run the kernel/workload several times before timing to ramp clocks, warm caches, JIT/
   autotune. Discard warmup samples.
2. **Repeats.** Time **REPEATS=7** (perf_knowledge e2e standard; minimum median-of-3). Report **median + spread**.
3. **Noise band.** Treat anything within **~0.5%** e2e as noise — do not accept it as a win. Per-kernel
   microbench bands are tighter but still nonzero; quote the spread.
4. **Control clocks.** Lock or pin clocks for kernel microbenchmarks so DVFS variance doesn't masquerade
   as a speedup; e.g. `rocm-smi`/`amd-smi` to set a deterministic performance level. At minimum, monitor
   with `amd-smi metric` and reject runs where the clock drifted between ref and candidate.
5. **A/B same session, non-overlapping.** Run **ref** then **candidate** back-to-back in the *same*
   process/session on the *same* clocks; never compare numbers from two different sessions/boxes/days.
   The perf_knowledge aiter GEMM result used a 5-rep non-overlapping A/B (1548.9 → 1583.5 tok/s).
6. **Graphs for launch-bound work.** Use **HIP graphs / CUDA graphs** to replay a launch sequence with
   near-zero host overhead, both to *get* the real GPU-bound time and as a perf technique when the trace
   shows host-launch gaps ([`trace_analysis.md`](trace_analysis.md)).

## Per-leg vs 2-launch A/B
For an e2e serving change, prefer a **2-launch A/B** (full ref launch vs full candidate launch) over
summing **per-leg** microbenchmarks: per-leg sums miss overlap, caching, and dispatch interactions and
routinely disagree with e2e. The aiter GEMM tuning win (**+2.23% e2e** on Qwen3.5-27B/sglang) was
validated by a same-session 2-launch A/B, not by per-kernel sums
([`../operators/dense_gemm/tuning.md`](../operators/dense_gemm/tuning.md)).

## Reporting format
Follow conventions: `<value> @ <hw>, ROCm <ver>, <lib>@<commit/ver>, <date>`, e.g.
`+2.23% e2e @ MI300X gfx942, sglang 0.5.11 / aiter, 2026-06-08`. Median of ≥3 (preferably 7) warm
repeats, with spread; never present theoretical peak as achievable.

## Pitfalls
- Accepting a sub-0.5% delta as a win → noise ([`common_pitfalls.md`](common_pitfalls.md)).
- Timing a profiled/traced run → counter replay and tracer overhead inflate it.
- Cold-cache first run counted in the median; clock not yet ramped.
- Comparing across sessions/days — clocks, thermals, and background load differ.
- Trusting summed per-leg microbenchmarks over a real e2e 2-launch A/B.

## Verify
A real win clears the 0.5% band across REPEATS=7, reproduces on a re-run of the same A/B, and is
accompanied by an engagement proof that the change is actually live
([`engagement_verification.md`](engagement_verification.md)).
