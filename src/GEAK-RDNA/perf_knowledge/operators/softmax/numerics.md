# softmax — numerics & parity

## 1. Max-subtraction is mandatory
`exp(x_i)` overflows fp32 at x>88. Always subtract the row max: `exp(x_i − m)`. The online formulation
keeps a running max and corrects (`sum *= exp(m_old − m_new)`) — algebraically identical, numerically
safe. Skipping max-subtraction = NaNs on large logits.

## 2. fp32 exp + accumulate
exp and the sum accumulate in **fp32** even with bf16/fp16 IO; the final divide and convert-to-out happen
last. bf16 exp/accumulate loses precision in the tail (small probabilities) → wrong sampling.

## 3. Online correction = exact
The online (flash) softmax is **not** an approximation — the correction factor makes it bit-equivalent to
the two-pass up to fp rounding. But the **reduction/block order differs** from a naive softmax → last-bit
differences. After swapping softmax (or attention backend), re-gate greedy/temp=0 parity.

## 4. Sampling sensitivity
For sampling (top-p/top-k) the softmax tail matters: a bf16-accumulated sum shifts low-probability tokens.
Use fp32 accumulate; gate sampling correctness with a fixed-seed distribution check, not allclose. See
[[sampling_topk_topp]].

## 5. Attention softmax
Inside FMHA the softmax is fused with a running `(m, l)` (max, normalizer) per the flash-attention scheme;
fp32 `m,l`; the PV accumulation rescales by `exp(m_old − m_new)`. Parity differences across AITER/Triton/
CK attention come mostly from this reduction order — re-gate after a backend swap. See
[[attention_prefill_fmha]].

## Parity gate
1. isolated vs fp64: rel-err band; no NaN on x∈[−1e4, 1e4].
2. routing/sampling: fixed-seed distribution match.
3. attention: greedy e2e parity after backend swap.
