# fused_moe_grouped_gemm  (the fused MoE up/gate/down grouped-GEMM mega-kernel)

## TL;DR
This is the compute heart of an MoE layer: the two grouped GEMMs (stage-1 gate+up, stage-2 down) over the
sorted per-expert token tiles, with activation and routed-weight combine fused in. On AMD it is
**`aiter.fused_moe`** — DB-driven, auto-selecting bf16 asm / fp8 block-scale / int8 / A4W4 by quant method.
The single most important fact: it is a **grouped GEMM** (many small per-expert GEMMs batched by the
align&sort permutation), so the lever is **fitting per-expert M-tiles to the 304 CUs** (the same
`moe_align_block_size` padding) and choosing the **quant path** (fp8 block-scale unlocks ~3× over an
unfused stack). This is the MoE specialization of [[grouped_gemm_moe]] and [[scaled_quant_gemm]].

## Math contract
Per expert `e`, over its assigned token rows `X_e [m_e, H]`:
1. **stage-1 (g1u1)**: `G = X_e · W_gate_eᵀ`, `U = X_e · W_up_eᵀ`; `A = act(G) ⊙ U` (SwiGLU). `w1` is
   `[E, 2·inter, H]` (gate+up fused). dtype: bf16 in / fp32 acc / bf16 (or fp8) intermediate.
2. **stage-2 (down)**: `Y_e = A · W_down_eᵀ`; `w2` is `[E, H, inter]`. Routed weight multiplied here
   (`MulRoutedWeight1`) or in stage-1 (`doweight_stage1`).
- The "grouped" part: tokens are pre-sorted (align&sort) so each expert's rows are a **contiguous,
  BLOCK_M-padded** run → one kernel does all experts. Only the **M-axis is grouped**; N (=inter/H) and K
  (=H/inter) are fixed per stage (cf. DeepGEMM's M-grouped design).

## Shape regimes
- **prefill (large M total)**: per-expert `m_e` can be large; compute-bound grouped GEMM → tile to fill 304
  CUs. DeepSeek-V3: H=7168, inter=2048, E=256, top-8.
- **decode (small M total)**: each expert sees few tokens (often `m_e < BLOCK_M`) → **padding waste**
  dominates and the GEMM is skinny/memory-bound. Masked grouped GEMM (DeepGEMM-style) avoids launching
  empty-expert work; CUDA-graph-friendly because the CPU doesn't know per-expert counts.

## Where it matters (Amdahl)
On an MoE model the grouped GEMM is the **largest GPU-time term of the MoE layer** (the experts are the
bulk of the parameters). AMD reports fused MoE up to **3×** vs an unfused stack, and block-scale fp8 fused
MoE is the headline MI300X MoE optimization. A 1.2× here moves e2e materially on MoE-heavy models.

## Backend landscape (→ SOTA cards)
| backend | status | card |
|---|---|---|
| aiter | 🟢 sota (live `fused_moe`, DB-driven) | [backends/aiter.md](backends/aiter.md) |
| ck | 🟢 sota (stage-2 `moe_ck2stages_*`, block-scale) | [backends/ck.md](backends/ck.md) |
| hip | 🟢 (stage-1 hand-tuned asm `fmoe_stage1_*`; editable) | [backends/hip.md](backends/hip.md) |
| triton | 🟡 competitive (vLLM/sglang Triton fused-MoE; per-shape JSON tuned) | [backends/triton.md](backends/triton.md) |
| flydsl | 🟢 sota (fp4 a4w4 2-stage + fused act/requant, CDNA4) | [backends/flydsl.md](backends/flydsl.md) |

## Fusion neighbors
- **act_and_mul (SwiGLU) fused into stage-1** (`g1u1`); **routed-weight multiply** into stage-1/stage-2
  epilogue; **fp8 quant/dequant** in the epilogue ([[scaled_quant_gemm]]); **shared-expert** folded in
  ([[shared_expert_fusion]]). Consumes [[moe_routing_topk]] + [[moe_dispatch_combine]] output. See
  [fusion.md](fusion.md).

## Numerics
fp32 accumulate; fp8/int8/fp4 block-scale introduces quant error (DB rows carry `err1`/`err2`, e.g.
stage-2 ~2.3%). fnuz vs OCP fp8 on gfx942 vs gfx950. Validate **end-to-end** accuracy, not just kernel
tolerance. See [numerics.md](numerics.md).

## How to bench
aiter MoE tuner over `untuned_fmoe.csv`; isolated per-shape grouped-GEMM timing; e2e MoE model tok/s with a
tuned `tuned_fmoe.csv` deployed. Oracle = greedy/temp=0 + a small eval for quant paths.
