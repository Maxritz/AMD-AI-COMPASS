# attention_decode_paged — tuning

Paged decode is **memory-bandwidth + launch-latency bound**, not FLOP-bound (the query is one token).
So tuning is about (1) filling 304/256 CUs when batch is small, (2) coalescing the KV-cache reads, and
(3) cutting launch overhead. There is no big GEMM to tile.

## Pick the backend first (vLLM ROCm, Feb 2026)
Ranking: **ROCM_AITER_FA > ROCM_AITER_UNIFIED_ATTN > TRITON_ATTN > ROCM_ATTN**. ROCM_AITER_FA vs legacy
ROCM_ATTN TPS (64/128 req): **MI300X 3.82×/2.65×, MI325X 4.36×/3.12×, MI355X 3.61×/2.88×**; TPOT
**2.8–4.6×** faster. The single biggest decode "tune" is not landing on the ROCM_ATTN/Triton fallback.

## Lever 1 — splitKV / flash-decoding (the main lever)
With `sq=1` and small batch, a naive one-CU-per-(batch,head) grid starves the GPU. Split the KV history
into chunks across CUs, compute partial `(O, m, ℓ)` per chunk, then a **reduce kernel** combines them.
- aiter custom paged-attn: `_PARTITION_SIZE_ROCM = 256` (the per-split KV chunk);
  `num_partitions = ceil((max_seq_len + 256 - 1) / 256)`. `paged_attention_v2` is the split path,
  `paged_attention_v1` the single-pass path.
- aiter MLA decode: `num_kv_splits` is auto-picked by `get_meta_param` from batch/total-KV/heads — leave
  it `None` (auto) unless you measured a better value.
- Triton flash-decoding: `NUM_KV_SPLITS` constexpr; combine in a stage-2 reduce kernel.
- **Rule**: more splits when batch×heads is small (fill CUs); fewer when batch is already large (avoid
  reduce overhead). The auto heuristics encode this — trust them first.

## Lever 2 — KV-cache layout & coalescing
- **NHD vs HND**: pick the layout the kernel reads coalesced. vLLM's custom path reshapes to
  `[2, num_blocks, block_size*num_kv_heads*head_size]` with `x = 16/elt_size` inner split on K so each
  lane reads a 128-bit chunk. `VLLM_ROCM_SHUFFLE_KV_CACHE_LAYOUT=1` reshuffles for the AITER FA path at
  concurrency ≥32.
- **block_size / page_size**: 16 common; larger pages reduce block-table indirection but coarsen memory.
  Tune `--page-size N` per model.
- Verify coalescing in ISA: want `global_load_dwordx4` / `buffer_load_dwordx4` on the KV reads.

## Lever 3 — MFMA path vs small-head path
vLLM custom paged-attn has two kernels:
- `paged_attention_ll4mi_QKV_mfma16_kernel` — MFMA-16 main path (use matrix core for the q·Kᵀ).
- `paged_attention_ll4mi_QKV_mfma4_kernel` — MFMA-4 small-head path.
Plus `paged_attention_ll4mi_reduce_kernel` for the cross-split softmax reduce. Templated on `BLOCK_SIZE`,
KV dtype, fp8 KV. Use `matrix_instr_nonkdim=16`, `waves_per_eu` to trim VGPRs (decode is memory-bound →
favor occupancy 3-4).

## Lever 4 — launch overhead (small batch)
Decode at small batch is launch-bound. Levers: HIP-graph capture (CUDA-graph equiv), persistent kernels
(`SGLANG_AITER_MLA_PERSIST=1`), and **unified attention** (one kernel for chunked-prefill+decode, avoids
two launches — see [[../chunked_prefill/overview.md]]). `HSA_NO_SCRATCH_RECLAIM=1` is near-mandatory on
MI300X (stops scratch-reclaim idle gaps).

## Head-dim / GQA specifics
- Supported head sizes (aiter custom paged-attn): **64, 80, 96, 112, 120, 128, 192, 256** — 192/256 are
  CDNA3/4-relevant. An unsupported head size falls back to Triton decode (`ROCM_ATTN` cliff: 2.7–4.4×
  slower).
- `gqa_ratio` (q-heads per kv-head) must be **1..32** for the custom path; the kernel broadcasts each KV
  head across its query-head group in-register (no KV replication in HBM) — see
  [[../gqa_mqa_attention/overview.md]].
- `max_seq_len ≤ 65536` for the custom paged-attn fast path.

## fp8 KV-cache
Store K/V as fp8 (half the KV bandwidth = directly faster decode), dequant on read. FNUZ on gfx942, OCP
on gfx950. `--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3` (fnuz on MI300X). This is the **highest-leverage** decode tune for
long context — but it is an accuracy gate (see [numerics.md](numerics.md)). Note: aiter MLA decode does
**not** support fp8 KV-cache in vLLM upstream.

## How to verify a tune helped
Isolated decode bench at the served `(batch, heads, kv_heads, head_dim, context, block_size, dtype)`,
median ≥3 warm reps. rocprofv3 → confirm `paged_attention_ll4mi_*` (not a Triton fallback) ran. e2e:
TPOT at served concurrency + greedy temp=0 parity.
