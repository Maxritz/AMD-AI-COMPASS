# shared_expert_fusion — fusion

This operator **is** a fusion — folding the always-on shared MLP into the sparse routed MoE. The levers are
*how deep* the fold goes and how it overlaps.

## Fusion depth ladder (shallow → deep)
| level | what's merged | where | payoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (none) | separate shared Linear + activation + residual add | baseline | — |
| 1 overlap | shared dense GEMM on a **separate stream/HW queue**, atomic-add into routed result | `GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=2` + aiter atomic-add | hides shared under routed compute |
| 2 fused kernel | shared stage-1/stage-2 run in the **same fused-MoE pipeline**, atomic-add | `fused_moe_dp_share_expert` | one launch, MFMA stays busy across both |
| 3 fused dispatch (EP) | shared injected as a **synthetic routed expert** (weight 1) → one dispatch for shared+routed | Wide-EP `grouped_topk` trick | single fused dispatch ([[moe_dispatch_combine]]) |

## The atomic-add seam
aiter passes the **no-shared MoE result buffer** into `fused_moe_dp_share_expert`; the shared output is
**atomic-added** onto it. This is the fusion glue — the shared and routed parts can be computed in any order
/ concurrently and still sum correctly (modulo bf16 atomic-add order, [numerics.md](numerics.md)).

## EP: shared-as-synthetic-routed-expert
Under Wide-EP, the shared expert is given top-k slots via `grouped_topk` so it dispatches with the routed
experts — **one** all-to-all carries both. This is why `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER_FUSION_SHARED_EXPERTS` is
**incompatible with MoRI**: under MoRI the fusion is done MoRI-side (the synthetic-expert injection), not
via the vLLM op. Pick one.

## Fusion neighbors
- builds on [[fused_moe_grouped_gemm]] (the routed grouped GEMM the shared expert joins).
- shared routing folded into [[moe_routing_topk]] (the gate kernel can emit the shared slot).
- shared dispatch folded into [[moe_dispatch_combine]] (EP, synthetic expert).
- shared expert can be fp8 block-scale → shares the dequant epilogue ([[scaled_quant_gemm]]).

## What is NOT yet fused
- A **single kernel** that computes shared + routed + combine with no global round-trip of either
  intermediate (the north-star single-kernel MoE) — not on AMD yet.
- Shared expert keeping its `[M,inter]` intermediate in LDS across stage-1→stage-2 (materialized today).
