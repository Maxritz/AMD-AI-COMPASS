# batched_gemm — fusion

## TL;DR
The single most important "fusion" for batched GEMM is **into attention**: QKᵀ and PV batched matmuls
get fused with softmax into a fused-MHA kernel, so the [B,H,S,S] scores never hit HBM. After that, the
same epilogue fusions as dense (bias/act/scale) apply per batch.

## Fusion neighbors
- **→ attention (FMHA)**: QKᵀ·softmax·PV fused — the dominant case; standalone batched GEMM should only
  survive where attention isn't fused. See [[operators/attention_prefill_fmha/overview.md]],
  [[operators/gqa_mqa_attention/overview.md]], [[operators/mla_attention/overview.md]].
- **+bias / +act epilogue (per batch)**: same CShuffle-style epilogue as dense →
  [[operators/gemm_epilogue_fused/overview.md]].
- **+fp8 quant epilogue (per batch)**: scaled write-out so the next batched matmul consumes fp8 →
  [[operators/scaled_quant_gemm/overview.md]].
- **→ grouped GEMM**: when per-batch shapes differ (MoE experts), fuse into a single grouped launch
  instead of padded batched → [[operators/grouped_gemm_moe/overview.md]],
  [[operators/fused_moe_grouped_gemm/overview.md]].

## Why it pays
The attention fusion removes the giant [B,H,S,S] scores tensor (memory-bound) — far larger than any
epilogue win. Per-batch epilogue fusions remove a [B,M,N] elementwise pass, same Amdahl logic as dense.

## How it's expressed per backend
- **CK**: `DeviceBatchedGemmMultipleD_Xdl_CShuffle` with a `CDEElementwise` epilogue per batch.
- **triton**: append epilogue after MFMA before the per-batch store; `OPTIMIZE_EPILOGUE=1`.
- For attention fusion, use the dedicated FMHA kernels, not a fused batched-GEMM.

## Pitfalls
- Fused shape/flags change the tuning key → tune the fused variant.
- Padding variable per-batch shapes into one batched kernel wastes FLOPs — prefer grouped GEMM.
