# sparse_attention_nsa — fusion

## What fuses (and what deliberately doesn't)
| fusion | where | note |
|---|---|---|
| **selected + sliding-window branches** | one Triton kernel | FLA ships a fused kernel combining selected attention with the sliding branch (2025-02 release) |
| **compressed-KV pooling** | pre-step | block-mean/learned pooling into block summaries; feeds both the compressed branch and the selection score |
| **indexer / fp8 MQA logits** | the selection score | DeepSeek runs it in fp8; its output ranks blocks (top-k). Kept as its own kernel (it's the hot path) |
| **online top-k** | inside the indexer epilogue | avoids materializing the full score matrix (FLA) |
| **fnuz quantise-and-insert KV** | KV-cache write | fused quantise + paged insert so cache bytes match the fnuz dialect (V4 bring-up) |
| **RoPE / qk-norm** | before scoring | standard ([[rope]], [[rmsnorm]]) |
| **gather of selected blocks** | the selected-branch load | indexed/masked `buffer_load`; the non-contiguous gather is the perf-sensitive seam ([[gather_scatter]]) |

## What FSA deliberately *splits* (anti-fusion)
Flash Sparse Attention found that **decoupling** is faster than one mega-kernel for the selected branch:
- online-softmax statistics → a **separate pre-compute kernel**;
- attention accumulation → **another kernel**;
- plus an **early-return** on empty index tensors.
This avoids loop-order stalls from non-contiguous query access — so for the selected branch, *less*
fusion can win on AMD. Benchmark both.
