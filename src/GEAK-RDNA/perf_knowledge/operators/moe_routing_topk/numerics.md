# moe_routing_topk — numerics & parity

## What "correct" means here
The router's output (`topk_ids`, `topk_weights`) **picks which experts run and how their outputs are
weighted** — a wrong id sends a token to the wrong expert (a real quality regression), while a tiny
weight perturbation is usually benign. So the parity gate is **expert-id match + weight closeness**, not
byte parity.

## Benign vs real divergence
- **Benign (numerical-equivalence-class)**: when two experts have near-equal gate scores, fp32 reduction
  order differences across backends (HIP DPP vs CK vs Triton vs torch) flip the **tie-break** → a different
  but equally-valid expert id. On a long greedy decode this shows up as occasional token differences. Gate
  with a parity probe over ≥10 prompts; don't fail on a single argmax flip near a tie.
- **Real regression** (must fail the gate):
  1. **Wrong scoring function**. The aiter biased-grouped HIP kernel **hardcodes `isSoftmax=false`** —
     it always applies **sigmoid** regardless of the requested `scoring_func` (aiter #2153). Using it for a
     **softmax-scored** model (Mixtral/Qwen-MoE) yields wrong weights and `test_grouped_topk` fails. Assert
     `scoring_func=="sigmoid"` before taking the aiter biased path; route softmax models to the plain
     `topk_softmax` / Triton path. (vLLM #17955 review flagged exactly this — `scoring_func` is "assumed".)
  2. **Incomplete group reduction**. `THREAD_PER_GRP = 64/num_expert_group`; cross-lane reduction is only
     implemented for `THREAD_PER_GRP ∈ {2,4,8}`. For unsupported `num_expert_group` (e.g. 4 → 16, or any
     value driving `lane_steps→0`), each lane sees only a **subset** of its group's experts → wrong group
     scores → wrong groups selected. Verify your model's `num_expert_group` is supported before enabling.

## fp8 / quant interaction
The router itself runs in fp32 even when the GEMM is fp8 — the gate logits come from a bf16/fp16 linear.
The **numeric risk moves downstream**: where the routed weight gets multiplied (`doweight_stage1`,
`MulRoutedWeight1`) and the fp8 grouped GEMM quant error ([[fused_moe_grouped_gemm]], [[scaled_quant_gemm]]).
Keep the routed-weight multiply in fp32/bf16 before any fp8 cast.

## Renormalization & scaling
`need_renorm` (divide the k weights by their sum) and `routed_scaling_factor` must be applied in the same
fp32 domain and in the **same order** as the reference, or the combined output drifts. DeepSeek applies
bias for *selection* but the **original (unbiased) score** for the *weight* — a common porting bug is using
the biased score as the weight.

## Verification recipe
1. Isolated: `aiter/op_tests/test_moeTopkSoftmax.py` and `test_moe_topk_sigmoid.py` — compare ids+weights
   vs `biased_grouped_topk_torch` / `grouped_topk_torch` references at E∈{64,128,256}, k∈{2,6,8}.
2. e2e: greedy/temp=0 on a MoE model, `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=1` vs `=0`; expect occasional benign argmax
   flips only. A systematic divergence (every prompt) ⇒ scoring/group bug above.
3. Run `tests/kernels/moe/test_routing.py::test_grouped_topk` with `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=1` — it is the
   canonical detector for both bugs.
