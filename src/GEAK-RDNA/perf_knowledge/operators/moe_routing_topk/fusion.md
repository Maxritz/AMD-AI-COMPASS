# moe_routing_topk — fusion

The router is a chain of tiny kernels; almost every win is **collapsing launches** and **pushing the
routed-weight multiply downstream**.

## Fusions that exist on AMD today
| fusion | what it merges | where | payoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| **gate + bias + grouped top-k** | softmax/sigmoid + correction_bias + group-select + within-group top-k + renorm/scale | `moe_fused_gate` / `biased_grouped_topk` (one HIP/DPP kernel) | 1 launch instead of 4–5; the DPP path is 1.66× over CK |
| **routed-weight multiply → grouped-GEMM epilogue** | the `topk_weights` multiply folded into stage-1 (`doweight_stage1`) or stage-2 (`MulRoutedWeight1`) of fused MoE | aiter fused_moe / CK `moe_ck2stages_*` | removes a separate weighted-combine pass |
| **shared-expert as synthetic routed experts** | shared MLP injected into the top-k slots so it dispatches with routed experts | Wide-EP / [[shared_expert_fusion]] | one fused dispatch for shared+routed; no separate Linear+add |
| **softmax routing + shared-expert sigmoid in one launch** | when `topk_softmax` supports sigmoid fusion, the routing softmax and the shared-expert sigmoid gate share a kernel | vLLM AITER fused-MoE V1 (PR #17955) | 1 launch; else a fallback injects shared weights into the AITER buffer |
| **align&sort fused with histogram** | per-expert count + padded sorted permutation in one multi-block kernel | `moe_align_block_size` | the 7× MI300X win |

## The hand-off seam (router → next stage)
The router's real product for fusion is the **align&sort output**:
`(sorted_token_ids, expert_ids, num_tokens_post_pad)`. Two consumers:
- **single-GPU**: feeds [[fused_moe_grouped_gemm]] directly (contiguous per-expert tiles).
- **expert-parallel**: feeds [[moe_dispatch_combine]] — MoRI-EP `dispatch(input, indices)` takes the
  int32 `topk_ids` directly; the per-token routing weight is then **multiplied during combine**, not in
  the router. So under EP the router should emit weights and **stop** — don't pre-multiply.

## What is NOT yet fused on AMD
- **Router fully fused into the dispatch kernel** (gate→select→permute→send in one GPU-initiated kernel)
  is the north-star (cf. single-kernel a2a studies) but not shipped; the router and dispatch are separate
  launches today.
- **Gate-GEMM (router linear `[H,E]`) + softmax+topk** is usually two kernels — the router GEMM is a tiny
  dense GEMM ([[dense_gemm]]) and the gate is a separate elementwise+reduce; fusing them is rarely worth it
  because the GEMM is bandwidth-bound on the `[H,E]` weight.

## Decode-path discipline
On decode, fuse aggressively and **HIP-graph-capture the whole router** (gate+topk+align&sort) so the
3–5 launches become one graph replay; hoist all `torch.empty`/memset out (see [tuning.md](tuning.md)).
