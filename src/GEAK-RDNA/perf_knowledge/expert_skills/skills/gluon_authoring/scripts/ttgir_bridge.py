"""TTGIR <-> Gluon layout bridge, driven by the compiler instead of by a regex.

WHY THIS EXISTS, next to ttgir_to_gluon.py
------------------------------------------
`ttgir_to_gluon.py` reads the `.ttgir` as TEXT and carries a hand-written mapping
from each `#ttg.<kind>` spelling to a `gl.*` constructor. That mapping is the thing
that rots: it has to track every attribute rename (`isTransposed` vs `isTranspose`),
every generation change (`warpsPerCTA` vs `ctaLayout`), and every field that gets
added upstream. When it falls behind, it does not fail -- it emits a layout that is
missing a field, and the anchor is then silently not the champion.

Upstream already owns that mapping, completely, in C++:
`layoutToGluon()` (`python/src/gluon_ir.cc`) converts any TTGIR layout attribute
into the corresponding `gluon.language` object, field for field, and raises on a
kind it does not handle. It is reachable from Python today, with no rebuild, as
`GluonOpBuilder.get_gluon_layout_from_tensor / _from_memdesc`.

So this tool does no layout parsing at all:

    .ttgir --[ir.parse_mlir_module]--> MLIR module   (the compiler parses it)
           --[walk + get_result]-----> Value
           --[layoutToGluon]---------> gl.BlockedLayout(...) / gl.amd.AMDMFMALayout(...)

Three consequences worth stating, because they are the reason to switch:

  1. No mapping to maintain, and no way to be silently behind upstream. A layout
     kind with no Gluon constructor surfaces as an explicit UNRECOVERABLE row
     naming the kind -- never as a plausible-looking wrong constructor.
  2. Shapes come for free. The encoding arrives attached to its use site
     (`tensor<128x64xf16, #ttg.blocked<...>>`), so `linear` / `padded_shared` no
     longer need a shape guessed from GF(2) bases.
  3. Equivalence can be SEMANTIC. `to_linear_layout()` normalises any layout to its
     LinearLayout, so `verify` compares normal forms. Counting attribute
     occurrences -- which is what a text diff ends up doing -- compares the plain
     pipeliner's unroll factor and can never pass against a pre-pipeline anchor.

MODES
-----
  recover   .ttgir -> Gluon layout constants (+ JSON facts), with per-use-site
            provenance and a round-trip proof for every layout.
  verify    plain.ttgir vs anchor.ttgir, compared as LinearLayout normal forms.
            Multiplicity is REPORTED and never gates.
  view      render a layout as an ASCII per-lane table (`get_layout_view`), to
            choose between candidate shared layouts by their access pattern.
  --selftest  offline, no GPU, no Triton required for the pure parts.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Needs the installed Triton (`import triton`), because the whole point is to use the
compiler's own attribute parser and layout classes. No GPU, no kernel launch, no
compile -- so it runs wherever `import triton` works, including inside the
container while the host has no torch.

#
# Produced by scripts/ttgir_bridge.py recover (arch={arch}, triton={tver}).
# The Triton version is stamped because it changes what this tool can PARSE (3.6 cannot
# read a dump containing ttg.barrier) and how `verify` compares shared layouts (3.6 falls
# back to canonical text). The recovered file is the artefact people keep; without the
# stamp there is no way to tell later which build produced it.
# Every constant below came from the COMPILER's own layoutToGluon(), not from a
# text parse, and each one carries a round-trip proof that re-printing it yields
# the identical MLIR attribute.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE USING THE FILE:
#   * Declaring a layout is not applying it. These constants do nothing until they
#     are passed as `layout=` on the tensor that plays that role -- `gl.arange(...,
#     layout=gl.SliceLayout(d, X_LOAD))` for index tensors, `gl.allocate_shared_
#     memory(..., X_SMEM)` for staging, `gl.convert_layout(x, A_DOT_OPERAND)` before
#     the dot. An anchor that declares them and leaves the body on AutoLayout
#     compiles, is bit-exact, and is several times slower.
#   * NUM_WARPS below is pinned BY these layouts. Changing it at the launch site
#     without re-recovering is a correctness bug, not a slow config.
#   * Role names are HINTS derived from the use site. The authoritative facts are in
#     the provenance comment on each line (op, position, shape).
# ===========================================================================
# gl.amd is reachable from gl, so the AMD layout classes need no second import.
