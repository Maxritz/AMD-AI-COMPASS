# Gluon Memory Reference (gfx950 / gfx942)

Required companions: `imports-and-launching.md` for launcher rules and
`layout-reference.md` for distributed offset/mask layouts. Per-target memory-path
support lives in `../hardware/capability-matrix.md`.

Use this file when deciding between generic `gl.load` / `gl.store` and AMD buffer
ops, or when debugging memory-path dtype, fallback, offset, or store issues. This
is the **memory-path layer** of the backbone.

For non-matrix Gluon body work, keep the same discipline: first prove the generic
memory anchor, then add buffer ops, shared staging, or async copy only when they
remove a named body cost (branchy masks, address-register pressure, traffic,
repeated layout conversion, or a consumer-layout mismatch).

## Start With Generic Memory Ops

Start with generic `gl.load` / `gl.store` unless there is a clear AMD memory
mechanism.

Move to AMD buffer ops only when:

- the path is streaming or memory-bound;
- an existing AMD Gluon path uses buffer operations;
- dtype, fallback value, value layout, and target family are known;
- the memory path is hot enough to pay for extra specificity;
- a same-shape correctness probe has passed against the generic anchor.

`buffer_load` / `buffer_store` are namespaced by target: `gl.amd.cdna4.*` on
gfx950, `gl.amd.cdna3.*` on gfx942. Namespace swap alone is not an optimization
direction (equivalent operand types can generate the same ISA). Do not add buffer
ops only to avoid a `where`; measure the memory path first. Buffer paths have
been observed to compile and run but read wrong values — require a correctness
gate, not a blanket rejection.

## Buffer Pointer And Offset Rules

- `buffer_load(base_ptr, offsets, ...)` / `buffer_store(base_ptr, offsets, ...)`
  use a scalar base pointer plus distributed offsets.
- They are not textual replacements for `gl.load(ptr + offsets)`.
- offsets must be int32 or uint32 on supported AMD buffer paths.
- int64 offsets from page/block ids multiplied by large strides are a hard
  constraint, not a performance preference.
- treat offsets as byte offsets unless operator-local source proves otherwise.
- for non-1-byte element types, re-check source expressions written as element
  offsets and multiply by bytes per element when byte offsets are required.
- the base pointer must be scalar pointer-like; restructure `ptr + offsets`
  tensor pointers before buffer ops.

## Buffer Dtype Rules

- `buffer_load(..., other=...)` casts the fallback to the loaded pointer element
  type. For generated code prefer a typed Gluon value:

```python
other = gl.full(shape, 0.0, ptr.dtype.element_ty, layout=layout)
```

- `buffer_store(..., stored_value=...)` must store a value whose element dtype
  matches the destination pointer element type. Cast widened accumulators before
  storing.

## Async Copy To Shared

`buffer_load_to_shared` (CDNA4 async copy) requires 32-bit offsets and an
offset tensor whose distributed layout matches rank, dtype, unit, and the
shared-memory consumer. A `BlockedLayout` lowering failure is **layout-contract
evidence** before it is a build ceiling — retry with a source-proven
`DistributedLinearLayout` matched to the consumer before recording a toolchain
ceiling. Do not interleave ordinary loads/stores with async paths without a
traffic/scheduling hypothesis. This is the main mechanism behind the pipeline
layer (`../tile-programming/pipeline.md`).

### Minimum per-thread granularity (applicability by dtype)

`buffer_load_to_shared` also requires the **per-thread chunk to clear the HW
async-copy granularity floor (~16 B/thread)**. A sub-floor load (e.g. a
small-element dtype with a narrow contiguous run) is **rejected at lowering**
(an `unrealized_conversion_cast` / lowering failure), which is **not** a build
ceiling and **not** fixable by switching the `BlockedLayout` family — it is the
per-thread *byte count*. The fix is to raise `size_per_thread` on the contiguous
dim until per-thread bytes clear the floor:

| Operand dtype | bytes/elem | contiguous elems/thread to clear ~16 B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bf16 / fp16 | 2 | >= 8 |
| fp8 / int8 | 1 | >= 16 |
| fp4 (e2m1, packed 2/byte) | 0.5 | >= 32 |

Tensors that are inherently sub-floor (a few elems/thread — typically block
scales) cannot use direct-to-LDS at all; route them through the register-staging
side path GR -> LW -> LR (`../tile-programming/low-precision.md`). This is a
layout/granularity constraint, not an async-path build ceiling — do not record it
as a `buffer_load_to_shared` capability failure.

> **Arch note (the floor is per arch, not universal).** The ~16 B/thread figure is
> the **CDNA4** 128-bit direct-to-LDS chunk. On **gfx942 / CDNA3 the widest
> direct-to-LDS load is 32-bit (4 B, 2×bf16) per thread** — 128-bit is CDNA4-only
> (`supportsDirectToLdsLoadBitWidth`: CDNA3 = {32}, CDNA4 = {128, 32}, GFX1250 =
> {128, 64, 32}). So on gfx942 the async path moves fewer bytes per instruction and
> tends to become `s_waitcnt`-bound; measure it against sync staging rather than
> assuming a win (`../hardware/capability-matrix.md ## Direct-to-LDS granularity
> (per arch)`).

### Shared-layout family + transpose-on-read (layout dependency)

Not every shared layout lowers for the async direct-to-LDS path:

- `SwizzledSharedLayout` lowers for `buffer_load_to_shared`; the padded-identity
  variant (`PaddedSharedLayout.with_identity_for`) has been seen to **fail to
  lower** for the async path — record as a known layout delta, not a build ceiling,
  and prefer `SwizzledSharedLayout` (or a source-proven `DistributedLinearLayout`
  matched to the consumer) for async.
- **Transpose-on-read**: to consume one LDS tile in two operand orientations
  (instead of storing it twice), store it once in natural order and read the
  transposed operand via `smem.permute((1, 0)).load(dot_layout)`. The conflict
  behaviour of reading a tile both ways and its mitigation live in
  `../tile-programming/layout-recipes.md ## Padding vs swizzle (LDS bank conflicts)`.

  **It is a saving only when the transpose is not already free. Check the ISA for
  an existing `ds_read_*_tr_*` before reaching for it.** The competing form —
  load in a linear layout and transpose in registers (`gl.permute` +
  `convert_layout`) — looks strictly worse in a census and can be strictly
  faster: on a gfx950 MLA forward pinned at 1 wave/SIMD, moving V's transpose
  from registers into the LDS read removed 51 instructions, left `mfma` and
  `ds_read` counts and `shared` bytes/WG **identical**, was bit-for-bit
  numerically equal — and lost **1.4 %** (1.0433x vs 1.0585x, interleaved A/B in
  one clean window; record the window's spread alongside, per `ab_bench.py`).
  The register path was already landing 384 `ds_read_b64_tr_b16`, i.e. the
  hardware was already doing the cheap part, so the transpose did not disappear:
  it moved into that read's bank pattern, while the `v_mov`s it replaced had been
  co-issuing under MFMA for free. On the same kernel a padding change to the same
  buffer cost 10–11 pp in both directions, so the LDS access pattern was the
  sensitive axis and the registers were not.

  The general rule this is an instance of is in
  [`../gluon-negative-patterns.md ## Instruction count is not the objective function`](../gluon-negative-patterns.md).

## gfx950 <-> gfx942 delta

- buffer ops: `gl.amd.cdna4.buffer_load/store` (gfx950) vs
  `gl.amd.cdna3.buffer_load/store` (gfx942);
- **async direct-to-LDS IS available on gfx942 — a namespace gap is not a silicon
  gap.** The `gl.amd.cdna3` namespace has no `async_copy` submodule (no
  `commit_group` / `wait_group` under `cdna3`), but
  `gl.amd.cdna4.async_copy.buffer_load_to_shared` + `commit_group` / `wait_group` +
  `load_shared_relaxed` **compile and run on gfx942** (verified correct). Do **not**
  conclude "gfx942 has no async copy" from the empty `cdna3.async_copy` — probe the
  `cdna4.async_copy` entry first, and only fall back to synchronous register staging
  once that path is shown non-viable for the specific layout. Backend truth:
  direct-to-LDS width is arch-gated (`supportsDirectToLdsLoadBitWidth`: CDNA3 = {32},
  CDNA4 = {128, 32}, GFX1250 = {128, 64, 32}) — see
  `../hardware/capability-matrix.md ## Direct-to-LDS granularity (per arch)`.
- **Real gfx942 async limits (verify each — these are layout/width facts, not the
  namespace myth):**
  - gfx942 direct-to-LDS granularity = **32-bit / 2×bf16 per thread** (the 128-bit
    chunk is CDNA4-only). A non-GFX1250 target also requires the fast dim to be
    **exactly covered** by `threads_per_warp * size_per_thread` (no replication).
  - transpose-B / complex dot-operand offset layouts under `AMDMFMALayout(v3)` +
    `SwizzledSharedLayout` can **fail LLVM translation**
    (`builtin.unrealized_conversion_cast`); the fix is `PaddedSharedLayout` + a
    source-proven `DistributedLinearLayout` matched to the consumer (a block-scale
    GEMM that stages a transposed operand is one upstream example of this pattern).
  - the **generic** `ttg.async_copy_global_to_local` is explicitly illegal on the
    gfx942 backend — use the `cdna4.async_copy` entry, not the generic op.
  - `compute_efficient_padded_shared_layout` asserts **v4-only** (unavailable on
    gfx942 / v3).
- Synchronous register staging (`buffer_load` -> shared `store` -> `LR` -> `DOT`,
  ordered by LDS read-after-write) is the fallback, not the default.

## Reduce divergence (predicate, not branch)

When VALU active-threads/wave is low (Branch Util high), replace boundary `if`-branches
around loads with predicated `buffer_load(..., mask=, other=)` so the wave stays
converged; pad/pow2-align ragged axes so the mask is uniform per wave.

```python
# predicated load instead of `if in_bounds: load` — uniform control flow
mask = offs_m[:, None] < M
a = gl.amd.cdna3.buffer_load(a_ptr, offs, mask=mask, other=0.0)   # no wavefront branch
```

Ref: `cdna3/cdna4.buffer_load(mask=, other=)` predication (upstream
`triton/experimental/gluon/language/amd/cdna3`). Note CDNA uses `mask=` on buffer ops
where gfx1250 uses a `pred=` on `tdm.async_load`. Verify: active-threads/wave up toward
wave_size, Branch Util down.

## Minimal Acceptance Checklist

```text
generic gl.load anchor is correct:
base pointer is scalar:
offset dtype is int32 or uint32:
offset unit is byte or source-proven:
mask layout matches offsets:
fallback dtype matches pointer element type:
stored value dtype matches destination:
benchmark boundary:
```

If any item is unknown, keep the generic path or shrink the probe. Symptom -> fix
routing: `../failure-triage.md`.
