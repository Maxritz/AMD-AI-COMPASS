## When to use
An fp8 **a8w8 block-scale** model (weight_block_size [128,128]) on MI300X where a dense GEMM head is the
top GPU-time mass and the per-(N,K) Triton config-JSON overlay is already exhausted (config tiling gives
only ~1.04–1.06x). Specifically the **K-heavy / narrow-N down-proj** (e.g. N=5120, K=17408, ~18% GPU on
Qwen3.5-27B-FP8): config tuning is near its ceiling, so the remaining lever is a **code-level authored
core**, not more config JSON.

## Mechanism
The stock blockscale GEMM dequantizes per 128×128 block then runs a bf16 MFMA. For the K-heavy down-proj
the win is **killing the dequant**: author a FlyDSL kernel (aiter's SOTA fp8 GEMM DSL on gfx942, JIT,
`is_flydsl_available()==True`) that folds the block-scale into the operand scale and runs **one fused
full-K low-precision MFMA core**, caching only compact fp8/preshuffled weights. Isolated this is ~2.43x
on the down-proj shape — far beyond the ~1.06x config tile. The catch that blocked earlier attempts: the
authored kernel crashed sglang's CUDA-graph capture (nested-graph / capture-unsafe). The fix is a
**capture-safe BARE-CORE bind** (the `nocgraph` overlay): bind the bare fused core over the live
blockscale path so it runs inside the existing captured graph instead of creating its own.

## Procedure
1. Confirm the head: profile shows fp8 a8w8 blockscale GEMM is the mass; isolate the down-proj (N,K).
   Confirm config tiling is exhausted (wide-N tile BM=128/BN=256 only ~1.04–1.06x prefill).
2. Author a **FlyDSL** fused fp8 a8w8 blockscale core (Tier-C, flydsl FIRST): baseline reuses
   `gemm_a8w8_bpreshuffle_flydsl` / `flydsl_preshuffle_gemm_a8`; the lever is the fused full-K MFMA with
   the block-scale folded into the operand scale. fp32 accumulate.
3. **Capture-safe bare-core bind** (critical): overlay the BARE core over the live blockscale GEMM
   (`aiter.ops.triton.gemm_a8w8_blockscale`), NOT a nested-graph wrapper. The earlier
   `cand_flydsl_downproj` overlay crashed at capture; the accepted `cand_flydsl_downproj_nocgraph`
   binds the bare core so it runs inside the existing captured decode graph.
4. **Memory is a hard constraint**: cache only compact fp8/preshuffled weights (~the model's own fp8
   weight size), never a bf16 expansion across all layers (that forces mem-fraction down → KV-cache
   starves → net e2e regression). Cache weight prep once by `weight.data_ptr()`.
5. Stack with `--attention-backend triton` (+2.24% on its own). e2e-gate the overlay vs the accepted
   stack with the tight Director same-session A/B.

## Knobs & pitfalls
- The h0 up/gate GEMM (wide-N, 57% GPU) is a **reject** for this exact lever: iso 1.10x but decode stays
  generic → e2e −0.26%. The down-proj (h1) is where the fused core pays off (+60.09% on the reference).
- The h2 qkv/o win is nested-graph / capture-unsafe → e2e 0%. Only the bare-core bind ships.
- FlyDSL entrypoints vary by build: `flydsl_preshuffle_gemm_a8` may be absent while
  `gemm_a8w8_bpreshuffle_flydsl` is present — check at author time.

## Do-no-harm notes
- Keep **decode** on the generic config where the wide-N/large tile would tank tiny-M (config-tile
  variant regresses decode ~0.6x). The fused core must not slow the decode path it overlays.
- Capture safety is non-negotiable: any host sync in the steady-state hot path deadlocks graph capture
  → 0 live forwards → e2e correctly rejects it. Verify live-forward count > 0 after overlay.
- When not triggered (non-fp8-blockscale model, or down-proj < min_pct_gpu), the skill is inert.

- Flagship measured result: 931.593 → 1559.934 tok/s = **1.674x (+67.4%)**, parity pass;

- Related memory: `flydsl-e2e-graph-capture-gap` (the capture crash this skill's bare-core bind resolves).
