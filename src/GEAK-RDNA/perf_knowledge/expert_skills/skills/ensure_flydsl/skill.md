# Ensure FlyDSL is importable (single source of truth for the FlyDSL build)

This skill makes `import flydsl, kernels.moe_gemm_2stage` resolve from ONE consistent tree, so the
FlyDSL optimization skills (`flydsl_rewrite_quantized_moe` for authoring, `apply_flydsl_moe_to_vllm`
for the e2e apply-back) can run. It is a **dependency skill**: other skills / the System Architect
invoke it; it is not selected from the profile Top-N on its own.

## When to run
**Primary: at Strategize, the moment a FlyDSL expert skill matches** — the System Architect runs this
skill BLOCKING right then (see `roles/system_architect.md` §0a), before routing flydsl, and updates the
environment (source `flydsl_env.sh`; add `flydsl` to `available_backends`). So flydsl is fully built and
importable before any downstream author/apply.
Also safe to invoke as an idempotent **step 0** of the flydsl author/apply skills as a belt-and-suspenders
guard — later calls short-circuit (version-gate reuse), so it never rebuilds.

## Procedure
Run the bundled executor (do NOT hand-roll clone/build — it carries the version gate, the ROCm-image
fixes, the concurrency lock, and the env file). A from-scratch build is ~15–18 min — **longer than the
Bash tool's 600 s ceiling — so launch it DETACHED and poll**, never as one foreground call:

```bash
FR="${FLYDSL_ROOT:-/opt/flydsl/FlyDSL}"; ENV="$FR/flydsl_env.sh"; FAIL="$(dirname "$FR")/.flydsl_build.failed"
SH="perf_knowledge/expert_skills/skills/ensure_flydsl/ensure_flydsl.sh"
nohup bash "$SH" > "$(dirname "$FR")/ensure_flydsl.log" 2>&1 &   # detached
for i in $(seq 1 180); do                                        # deadline 1800s (30 min)
  [ -f "$ENV" ]  && break                                        # success: flydsl_env.sh written
  [ -f "$FAIL" ] && { echo "flydsl build FAILED (see ensure_flydsl.log)"; break; }
  sleep 10
done
[ -f "$ENV" ] && source "$ENV" && \
  python3 -c "import flydsl, kernels.moe_gemm_2stage as k; print(flydsl.__file__, k.__file__)"  # ONE tree
```
Completion markers: **success = `flydsl_env.sh` exists**; **failure = `.flydsl_build.failed` exists**
(next to `$FLYDSL_ROOT`). Idempotent: if flydsl is already present the script writes `flydsl_env.sh`
almost immediately (version-gate reuse), so the poll returns in one tick.

## What the executor guarantees (`ensure_flydsl.sh`)
- **Version-only reuse gate**: if an ambient flydsl+kernels is importable with `__version__ >=
  FLYDSL_MIN_VERSION` (default `0.2.2`), REUSE it — never overwrites a newer flydsl, never pip-installs
  system-wide (portable / does not disturb other workloads). The pinned commit is NOT used to gate reuse.
- **Else clone + build the PIN** (`a35627a2…`) into container-internal `/opt/flydsl` (overlay fs, not a
  bind-mounted host dir), guarded by an `flock` so concurrent Setup/author retries can't corrupt one tree.
- **ROCm-image compat fixes applied before the build**: hip cmake symlink (cmake refs
  `libamdhip64.so.7.2.70201` but the runtime is `7.2.53211`) and auto-install `patchelf` (build.sh's
  `CopyFlyPythonSources` needs it) — the two failures that otherwise kill the source build late.
- **Writes `flydsl_env.sh`** (`FLYDSL_ROOT` / `PYTHONPATH` / `FLYDSL_SHIM_DIR` / `VLLM_USE_FLYDSL_MOE`)
  for the workflow + vLLM + subagents to source.
- Exit 0 ⇒ flydsl importable + env written. Non-zero ⇒ install failed (loud); the calling skill must
  drop flydsl and record why (do not silently fall back to triton).

## Overrides
- `FLYDSL_ROOT` — build/checkout location (default `/opt/flydsl/FlyDSL`).
- `FLYDSL_MIN_VERSION` — reuse floor (default `0.2.2`).
- `FLYDSL_BUILD_LOCK` — lock file path.
