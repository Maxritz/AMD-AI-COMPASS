# Host-side GPU-wedge pre-check. Runs BEFORE any rocminfo/rocm-smi/torch probe.
#
# WHY: when the AMD GPU/KFD driver wedges, tasks block in UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep
# (process state "D") inside the amdgpu/kfd/dma_fence kernel path. A D-state task
# cannot be killed — not by SIGTERM, not by SIGKILL, not by `timeout` — so if we
# naively run rocminfo/torch against a wedged driver, OUR probe hangs forever too
# (exactly what bit us: a stuck `rocminfo` the 120s preflight timeout couldn't
# reap, hanging the whole job toward its multi-hour wall-clock cap).
#
# This check touches NO GPU — it only reads /proc. It samples twice a few seconds
# apart and flags PIDs that remain in D state across BOTH samples (SUSTAINED, so a
# healthy task briefly in dma_fence_wait isn't misread as a wedge), then hard-fails
# if any such PID is a GPU tool (rocminfo/rocm-smi/amd-smi) or is parked in the
# amdgpu/kfd/dma_fence kernel path.
#
# Exit 0 = clear;  Exit 3 = wedged (offenders printed to stderr).  Never hangs.
