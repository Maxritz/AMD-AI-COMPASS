"""P0 acceptance smoke for Ray-managed GPU execution.

Demonstrates the make-or-break invariant on a real Ray cluster:

  1. A ServingActor holding num_gpus occupies the GPUs while alive.
  2. A second GPU actor requesting a GPU is *pending* (queued) until the
     serving actor releases — proving Ray serializes GPU contention.
  3. Killing the serving actor reaps its subprocess tree (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG) —
     no detached GPU process escapes the lease.

Runs against an already-running Ray cluster (does not start/stop one). Uses a
harmless ``sleep`` as the "GPU process" so no real model is loaded — this
validates Ray resource accounting + process lifetime, not throughput.

Usage:  python scripts/ray_exec_p0_smoke.py [--gpus N]
Exit 0 = all invariants held.
