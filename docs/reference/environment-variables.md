# Environment variables

User-configurable environment variables for Hyperloom, grouped by purpose.
Runtime parameters such as framework, tensor parallelism, prompt lengths, and
phase toggles are configured with CLI flags; internal subprocess handoff envs
are intentionally not listed as user configuration.

Variables marked **Required** must be set (using shell or `$REPO_ROOT/.env`)
or the CLI will exit fast at startup. Variables marked **Optional** have
sensible defaults; the default is shown in the **Default** column.

Precedence rule (applies everywhere): shell-exported env wins over `.env`.
See [Hyperloom authentication and credentials](authentication.md).

## Credentials

These variables configure LLM gateway access and optional backend credentials.

| Variable               | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SAFE_API_KEY`         | Conditional | —    | AMD primus-safe large language model (LLM) gateway key. Format `ak-...`. Required for the single-gateway setup; split-gateway deployments can instead provide provider-specific keys. Source for GEAK / Claude / Codex / Critic / Robustness credentials downstream (auto-aliased).                                                        |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`      | Conditional | —    | LLM gateway URL. Required for the single-gateway setup; split-gateway deployments can provide provider-specific base URLs instead. Example: `https://<your-gateway-host>/api/v1/llm-proxy/v1`.                                                                                                                  |

| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | No       | Inherits `SAFE_API_KEY` | Claude CLI auth token alias; set explicitly only for split-gateway deployments.                                                                        |
| `GEAK_API_KEY`         | No       | Inherits `SAFE_API_KEY` | Only set explicitly to override the default inheritance.                                                                                                                              |
| `GEAK_BASE_URL`        | No       | Inherits `OPENAI`<br>`_BASE_URL` | Only set explicitly to override the default inheritance.                                                                                                                          |
| `GEAK_CLAUDE_MODEL`   | No       | Inherits `CLAUDE_MODEL` | GEAKv4 Claude Code workflow model id.                                                                                                                                                           |

| `LANGFUSE_HOST`        | No (required <br> only <br> when `HYPER`<br>`LOOM_LA`<br>`NGFUSE`<br>`_ENABLE=1`) | Unset | Base URL of your Langfuse deployment (for example, `https://langfuse.<your-domain>`). Used by both the live trace push and the offline `backfill_langfuse` CLI. |
| `LANGFUSE`<br>`_PUBLIC_KEY`  | No (required <br> only <br> when `HYPER`<br>`LOOM_LA`<br>`NGFUSE`<br>`_ENABLE=1`) | Unset | Langfuse project public key (`pk-...`).                                                                                                                  |

## Path environment

The following variables configure filesystem paths for Hyperloom's runtime dependencies and session data.

| Variable                                  | Required             | Default                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REPO_ROOT`                               | No (recommended)     | `$(pwd)`                           | This Hyperloom checkout. Used to locate `.env`, skills, scripts. Falls back to the current working directory when unset.                                                                                                                     |
| `INFERENCEX_PATH`                         | Conditional          | Auto-cloned by `install.sh`                                    | Path to the SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX repo, used by baseline / target analysis. `install.sh` clones it when unset; only required if that auto-clone fails.                                                                                                                                          |
| `TRACELENS_ROOT`                          | No (installer auto-clones) | `${HYPER`<br>`LOOM_CA`<br>`CHE_DIR:-`<br>`$REPO_ROOT`<br>`/.cache}/Tr`<br>`aceLens@<resolved-sha>` (auto-clone of `AMD-AGI/TraceLens` pinned to a fixed SHA) | `src/hyperloom/agents/kernel/scripts/install.sh` clones the public repo into the repo-local cache root when unset. Export it to opt into a pre-existing checkout you maintain — that is an explicit operator override and skips both the clone and the SHA pin. |
| `GEAK_CLAUDE_BIN`                          | No (installer auto-resolves) | First of `$HOME/.local/bin/claude`, `/usr/local/bin/claude`, `$(command -v claude)`; written to `kernel-agent.env.sh` | Pins the Claude Code binary the GEAK SDK path uses, so `claude_agent_sdk` doesn't fall back to its older bundled CLI. Export to force a specific build. |
| `USER_DATA_PATH`                          | No                   | `/workspace/hyperloom`                                             | Session directory root (logs, runs, mirrors, breakdown). Replaces the retired `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_SESSION_DIR` and `WORKSPACE_PATH`.                                                |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMI`<br>`ZER_CU`<br>`RRENT_S`<br>`ESSION_DIR` | No (set by CLI) | Set at session boot | Absolute path to the active session directory. Written by the CLI when a session starts and inherited by every benchmark subprocess; session-path resolution prefers it over scanning `USER_DATA_PATH`. Do not set by hand. |
| `HYPERLOOM_ROOT`                          | No                   | `$HYPER`<br>`LOOM_R`<br>`UNTIME_`<br>`DIR/sou`<br>`rce-mirrors`                            | Legacy source-mirror root kept for compatibility. Current open-source dependency checkouts default to the repo-local cache root (`${HYPER`<br>`LOOM_CA`<br>`CHE_DIR:-`<br>`$REPO_ROOT`<br>`/.cache}`), not this path. |
| `HYPERLOOM`<br>`_CACHE_`<br>`DIR`                          | No                   | `$REPO_ROOT`<br>`/.cache`                      | Writable, repo-local base for auto-cloned open-source deps (TraceLens, Magpie, etc.), cloned per revision as `<name>@<sha>`. Not under `$TMPDIR` so a reaper cannot wipe it mid-run. |
| `MAGPIE_PATH`                              | No                   | Resolved from installed `Magpie` package unless explicitly set                               | Magpie package root for benchmark wrappers and patch inspection.                                                                                                                                            |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER`<br>`_MODEL_PATH_ROOTS` | No | Built-in model roots such as `/models` and `/shared_nfs` | `os.pathsep`-separated allowlist for absolute model paths restored from `state.json` during `--resume`. HuggingFace-style repo IDs remain allowed. Set this when production models live outside the built-in roots. |
| `SESSION_DIR`                             | No (robustness-agent)| Scan known paths                                                   | Path containing `storage/coordinator.db`; the robustness FindingSink writes under `{session_`<br>`dir}/ag`<br>`ents/ro`<br>`bustne`<br>`ss/fin`<br>`dings/`<br>`{sess`<br>`ion_id}.jsonl`.                                       |
| `ROBUSTNESS_SERVER_URL`                   | No (robustness-agent)| Scan known DNS                                                     | M1 primary data source; empty disables the primary path and forces local-only probes.                                                                                                |
| `WORKSPACE_PATH` *(legacy)*               | No                   | Unset                                                              | Legacy path variable. Still consumed in two narrow spots: the CLI `setdefault`s it to the repo root for the critic subprocess's static assets, and TraceLens uses it as a `USER_DATA_PATH` fallback. Prefer `USER_DATA_PATH`. See [Upgrade Hyperloom version](upgrade.md).                            |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMI`<br>`ZER_SES`<br>`SION_DIR` *(deprecated)* | No            | Unset                                                              | **Retired** — replaced by `USER_DATA_PATH`. No longer read.                                                                                                                       |

## Workload configuration

Set with CLI flags, not env vars. Pre-set `ISL` / `OSL` / `CONC` / `PRECISION` /
`TP` / `EP` env vars are ignored and overwritten (`GPU_TYPE` is a fallback when
`--gpu-type` is omitted).

- **Model / workload shape:** `--model`, `--model-class`, `--framework`,
  `--framework-version`, `--precision`, `--tp`, `--ep`, `--isl`, `--osl`,
  `--conc`, `--max-model-len`, `--profile-osl`.
- **Goal / budget:** `--target-gain`, `--max-hours`, `--target-summary`,
  `--target-tput`, `--compare-against-gpu`.
- **Cluster topology & multi-node backend:** `--nodes`, `--gpus-per-node`,
  `--gpu-type`, `--mn-backend` (`rayjob` / `infera`), `--server-args` (rayjob).
  Per-pod sizing, the pod image and pod-side env are the provisioning
  platform's inputs, not `optimize` flags — the cluster already exists by the
  time the optimizer runs.
- **PD disaggregation (infera):** `--pd-mode disaggregated`,
  `--pd-prefill-nodes` / `--pd-prefill-tp` / `--pd-prefill-ep` /
  `--pd-prefill-extra-args`, `--pd-decode-nodes` / `--pd-decode-tp` /
  `--pd-decode-ep` / `--pd-decode-extra-args`, `--pd-transfer-backend`,
  `--pd-ib-device`.
- **Phase toggles:** `--enable-roofline` / `--no-enable-roofline`,
  `--enable-conc-sweep` / `--no-enable-conc-sweep`, `--conc-sweep-concs`,
  `--no-framework-agent`, `--no-framework-local-explore`, `--no-kernel`,
  `--no-explore`.
- **Agent models:** `--claude-model`, `--codex-model`.
- **Session / resume:** `--resume`, `--resume-from`, `--force-resume`,
  `--reset-state`.
- **Quantization:** `--quantize`, `--quantize-scheme`.

Run `inference_optimizer optimize --help` for the exhaustive flag list.

## Accuracy gates

A candidate that clears the throughput bar must also hold accuracy before it is
kept. Grading runs only *after* the throughput bar is cleared, and reads the
score back from the run's own eval output, so a gate never costs an extra eval
and a regressing candidate never spends a verdict on itself.

In every lane a measured drop beyond the tolerance is a `REVERT`. A missing
verdict while a positive baseline accuracy is on record drops to
`NEEDS_REVIEW` — eval should have worked and didn't. No baseline accuracy at
all degrades to a throughput-only `KEEP` rather than blocking every candidate,
so eval-less environments still make progress.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RUN_EVAL` | `true` | Whether a serving benchmark runs the GSM8K eval. Turning it off removes the per-candidate accuracy signal entirely — accuracy regressions stop being caught. Ignored by scriptable (xDiT) workloads, whose correctness signal is the image `quality_gate` in `benchmark_report.json`. |
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER`<br>`_REQUIRE_KERNEL`<br>`_ACCURACY` | On | Gates the `KEEP` for a kernel patch integrated by the kernel lane. Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` to fall back to a throughput-only `KEEP`. Disable only when the eval lane is known-broken: this gate is what stops a faster-but-wrong kernel from being kept. |
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER`<br>`_REQUIRE_FRAMEWORK`<br>`_ACCURACY` | On | Same gate for a framework source patch authored by a specialist. Same disable spellings. |
| `MAGPIE_EVAL_LIMIT` | Unset (full task set) | Caps the number of eval problems (`lm_eval --limit`). Useful for smoke runs; see the noise caveat below before using it on a run whose `KEEP` decisions matter. |

The tolerance is deliberately **not** an env knob: `ACCURACY_THRESHOLD` in
`src/hyperloom/orchestrator/actions/executors/_accuracy_gate.py` is a fixed
`0.05`, i.e. a candidate must stay within 5 percentage points of the recorded
baseline accuracy.

Note that the score is measured once per candidate, not averaged over repeats.
On a full GSM8K run (1319 problems) the 5-point tolerance sits several standard
errors away from the baseline, so single-run noise does not trip it. Capping the
eval with a small `MAGPIE_EVAL_LIMIT` shrinks that margin sharply and can make
the gate noise-sensitive — prefer the full task set whenever a gate decision
depends on the result.

## Kernel-opt backend selection

The following variables control the kernel optimization backend ladder.

| Variable                       | Default                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER`     | Unset                         | Comma-separated override for the kernel-opt backend. Bare-metal defaults to `geak` (whole-pipeline GEAK). Use `forge` to opt into the forge backend.                    |
| `KERNEL_OPT_MAX_PARALLEL`      | `8` (GPU-adaptive cap)        | Max parallel kernel-opt attempts per request (per-kernel race fan-out). The runtime caps this by visible GPUs and per-attempt GPU reservation when it can detect them.                                                                                                                            |
| `HYPERLOOM_GEMM_SHAPE_CAPTURE` | `1`                           | Enables automatic runtime GEMM-shape capture for eligible single-node dense vLLM Forge tuning when no explicit shape input is available. Block-FP8 first reuses shapes from the TraceLens-selected steady-state trace of a successful Roofline with exactly matching model, workload, server arguments, environment, and backend controls. Missing or stale evidence triggers the same standard Roofline/ProfileExecutor/TraceLens steady-state pipeline as a fallback. Set to `0` to preserve the no-capture path. |
| `HYPERLOOM_GEMM_SHAPE_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `1800`          | Timeout in seconds for the dense vLLM TunableOp recording benchmark. Block-FP8 fallback uses the standard Roofline/ProfileExecutor timeout. Values below `60` are clamped to `60`. |
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER`<br>`_KERNEL_OPT_MAX_PARTIAL` | Unset           | Cap on how many `PARTIAL` kernel-opt verdicts an action can yield before it short-circuits to `NEEDS_REVIEW`. Useful for keeping budget contained when GEAK is consistently timing out.            |

---

## Single-node Ray execution

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAY_EXEC` | Unset (`on` for single-node) | Controls whether single-node serving benchmarks and `needs_gpu` specialists run through Ray actors. When unset, single-node runs are routed through Ray-managed leases while multi-node stays on the multi-node backend. Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` to force the local subprocess path, or `1` / `true` / `yes` / `on` to force Ray. |

---

## Codex (OpenAI) backend web search

The following variables enable OpenAI's built-in server-side web search for the
Codex (GPT-style) backend. When enabled, every Codex turn is issued through the
OpenAI **Responses API** with the built-in `web_search` tool instead of
`chat.completions`; the search resolves server-side in one call and the model's
reply still carries the intent envelope. Only affects deployments whose Codex
endpoint is OpenAI-compatible and supports the Responses API `web_search` tool.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH` | Unset (off) | Set to `1`/`true` to route every Codex turn through the OpenAI Responses API with the built-in `web_search` tool. Default keeps the existing `chat.completions` path unchanged. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`CODEX_WEB_SEARCH`<br>`_CONTEXT_SIZE` | `medium` | Passed through as the `web_search` tool's `search_context_size` (`low` / `medium` / `high`). Ignored unless `HYPERLOOM_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH` is on. |

---

## Single-node Ray GPU scheduling

These variables tune the single-node Ray execution path (active when
`INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAY_EXEC=1` and `--nodes=1`). They have no effect on
multi-node runs or when the Ray backend is disabled.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAY_GPU_PENDING_LIMIT` | `4` | Maximum number of GPU specialists that may be simultaneously in-flight (pending Ray scheduling + running) on the single-node Ray path. Ray still serialises execution on the physical GPU(s) via `num_gpus`; this limit caps how many actors can queue behind the current one. Floored at `1`. **Reduce to `1` or `2` when GPU memory or per-process overhead is a concern** (each queued actor holds a Ray worker slot even while it waits). |
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAY_SERVING_PRIORITY` | On | When enabled (default), the dispatcher defers admitting new GPU research specialists while a serving benchmark holds the whole-machine `serving_slot`, preventing research work from starving serving. The slot is probed immediately before each specialist is admitted so a serving start that races the dispatch pass is caught. Set to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` to disable. |

## Multi-node / prefill-decode (PD)

Use CLI flags for multi-node topology and prefill-decode configuration:

`--nodes`, `--mn-backend`, `--gpus-per-node`, `--tp`, `--ep`,
`--pd-mode`, `--pd-prefill-nodes`, `--pd-decode-nodes`, `--pd-prefill-tp`,
`--pd-decode-tp`, `--pd-transfer-backend`, and `--pd-ib-device`.

`optimize` never creates or releases a multi-node cluster. The provisioning
platform (e.g. Primus-Claw) creates the RayJob or InferaDeployment and hands it
over through the variables below; without a hand-off `--nodes >= 2` exits 2.

### Cluster hand-off variables

`HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SERVICE_URL` is the only variable that tells the optimizer a
cluster is ready; the rest describe how to reach it.

| Variable | Backend | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SERVICE_URL` | both | **yes** | Benchmark frontend URL (`http(s)://…`; infera frontend typically `:8000`). Its presence triggers external mode. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SSH_KEY` | infera | **yes** | Private SSH key already authorized on the pods (the platform installs the public half at create time). |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_PREFILL_IPS` / `_DECODE_IPS` | infera | PD | Prefill / decode pod IPs (comma-separated) for PD-disaggregated runs. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_WORKER_IPS` | infera | aggregated | Worker pod IPs (comma-separated) for aggregated (non-PD) runs. At least one of `_PREFILL_IPS` / `_DECODE_IPS` / `_WORKER_IPS` is required. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SSH_PORT` | infera | No (default `2233`) | SSH base port; decode role is offset `+10`. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` | infera | No | `known_hosts` path; else a relaxed host-key check is used. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_HEAD_IP` | rayjob | No (recommended) | Ray head IP (Dashboard `:8265`, GCS `:6379`). Enables per-round restarts; omit for benchmark-only. |
| `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_RAY_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` | rayjob | No | Ray Dashboard auth token, only if the dashboard is authenticated. |

Infera external mode requires `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_SSH_KEY` plus at least one
`*_IPS` list, or the run fails fast at startup. RayJob external mode ignores
the SSH / IP vars and uses `HYPERLOOM_MN_EXT_HEAD_IP` for restarts.

Multi-node SSH fanout creates session-scoped keys under the active session
directory. Treat `mn_id_ed25519` and `mn_id_ed25519.pub` as sensitive session
artifacts: keep the session directory on an access-controlled filesystem and
do not publish it unchanged in support bundles.

---

## Quantization prelude

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_QUANTIZE_ENABLED` | Unset | Primary switch (`1` to enable) for the AMD Quark PTQ quantization prelude driven by `--quantize` / `--quantize-scheme`. |
| `QUARK_ROOT` | Unset | AMD Quark checkout used by the quantization-agent. Set this explicitly when quantization is enabled. |

---

## Enablement admission

Enablement is **not** configured through the environment. Both self-heal lanes
are admitted by the `--enablement {off,launch,eval,all}` CLI flag, which defaults
to `all`:

- `launch` — a baseline that cannot boot routes into patch authoring.
- `eval` — a baseline that boots and measures throughput but fails its accuracy
  eval (crashes, produces no result, or scores below the floor) routes into
  patch authoring. Single-node only; multi-node keeps the strict stop.
- `all` (default) — both lanes.
- `off` — neither lane engages, and a baseline that keeps failing terminates the
  run with `stop_reason='baseline_failed'` instead of opening an authoring loop.

The accuracy floor shared by the eval trigger and the enablement KEEP gate is the
fixed constant `_accuracy_gate.DEFAULT_ENABLEMENT_ACCURACY_FLOOR` (`0.05`). It is
a collapse guard rather than a quality bar: a score of exactly `0.0` always fails,
otherwise `score >= floor` passes.

## Framework / source-tree discovery

The following variables configure framework source discovery and path overrides.

| Variable                                          | Default                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER_`<br>`FRAMEWORK_`<br>`SOURCE_ROOTS`      | Union with `/sgl-workspace`<br>`/{aiter,sglang`<br>`,vllm}`                        | Colon-separated list of source roots used by PolicyGate and flag discovery. Populated automatically by `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh`'s `_probe_framework_source_roots` step (using `hyperloom.orchestrator.framework.paths.probe_framework_source_roots_for_env`).   |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER`<br>`_RESCUE_PATHS`                | Unset                                                                  | Colon-separated list of extra directories the harvest step scans for stray `result.json` files written outside the session dir (InferenceX-native scripts that hardcode `--result-dir`). |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER`<br>`_AITER_JIT_DIR`               | Aiter default                                                          | Override the aiter just-in-time (JIT) cache root. See [Targeted builds (Rung 5)](#targeted-builds-rung-5).  |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER`<br>`_STRICT_PATHS`                | `1` when CLI bootstraps                                                | When `1`, missing path env raises instead of falling back to discovery. Set by the CLI at session start; do not override unless debugging.              |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`SGLANG_PA`<br>`TCH_EXACT`<br>`_VERSIONS`           | Unset                                                                  | Pin the sglang server-patch step to specific upstream versions; advanced compatibility option.                                                          |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`ENABLE`<br>`_PATCH`                          | `1`                                                                    | Set to `0` to skip the in-place server patch step (useful when the upstream is already pre-patched).                                                    |
| `AITER_REF` | Unset | Optional bare-metal AITER install pin. When unset, the installer selects the newest tag compatible with the installed torch/triton stack. |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER_`<br>`FRAMEWORK_`<br>`AUDIT_USE_LLM`      | `auto`                                                                 | Controls the FRAMEWORK phase semantic-audit LLM deep-read. `off` keeps the hermetic static verdict only; `on` always runs the evidence-gated LLM refine; `auto` (default) escalates to the LLM only when the static verdict is `unknown` or `confidence < 0.5`. The refine never upgrades to an `already_*` status the static layer did not already back with evidence. |

## Targeted builds (Rung 5)

These variables control the Rung-5 off-loop compiled-component acquisition
step (AITER FP4/MLA/NSA kernels, sgl-kernel, and vLLM from source).  All are
optional; defaults are safe for standard single-node deployments.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HYPERLOOM_ENABLEMENT_DISABLE_TARGETED_BUILD` | Unset (`0`) | Set to `1` to completely disable Rung-5 auto-escalation.  When set, compiled-gap failures proceed to the stall gate without attempting a build.  Useful when the compile toolchain is unavailable or the session budget is too tight. |
| `INFERENCE_`<br>`OPTIMIZER_`<br>`AITER_JIT_DIR` | Aiter default | Per-attempt override set automatically to `<attempt_root>/aiter_jit` by each targeted build.  Override manually only when you need the global JIT cache to point at a pre-built location; leaving it unset lets each build use its own isolated directory. |
| `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` | Detected | Explicit GPU target architecture (e.g. `gfx942`, `gfx950`) injected into each compile.  Set automatically from the session `--gpu-type`; operator-override applies to bare-metal installs outside the session. |
| `MAX_JOBS` | `8` | Parallelism cap for cmake/hipcc compile steps inside a targeted build.  Reduce on memory-constrained nodes (`MAX_JOBS=4` for a 64 GB compile node).  The default `8` is conservative enough for MI300X/MI355X nodes with 512 GB+. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`FRAMEWORK_PYTHON` | Unset | Explicit interpreter that launches the server for a from-source build (the venv Python the artifact was compiled against).  Set automatically from `FrameworkRuntime.runtime_python_exe` via `apply_runtime_override` into the per-variant YAML `benchmark.envs`.  The bypass backend honors it by launching `python -m`; the Magpie backend re-exports it from the YAML `benchmark.envs` to the server env.  Operators normally do not set this by hand. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`VLLM_ROCM_`<br>`INDEX_URL` | Unset | ROCm pip index URL used as the default vLLM adapter wheel index; also seeds the index allowlist. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`ENABLEMENT_`<br>`INDEX_ALLOWLIST` | Unset | Comma-separated allowlist of pip index URL prefixes; a candidate wheel index must match one of these prefixes or provisioning is refused (supply-chain safety). |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`ENABLEMENT_`<br>`ORIGIN_ALLOWLIST` | Unset | Comma-separated allowlist of git origin URL prefixes; a candidate repo origin must match one of these prefixes or provisioning is refused (supply-chain safety). |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`SGLANG_REPO_URL` | Unset | Override the SGLang source repo URL for the sgl-kernel / SGLang-from-source enablement build. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`SGLANG_REF` | Unset | Pin the SGLang source ref (tag/branch/sha) for the enablement build. |
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`SGLANG_INDEX_URL` | Unset | SGLang wheel index URL for the enablement build. |

> **Supply-chain security:** `HYPERLOOM_ENABLEMENT_INDEX_ALLOWLIST` and
> `HYPERLOOM_ENABLEMENT_ORIGIN_ALLOWLIST` are security controls.  When set, only
> pip index / git origin URLs matching one of the listed prefixes are accepted
> for runtime provisioning; any non-matching candidate is refused.

## Security compatibility switches

These switches keep production-compatible behavior by default while still
allowing operators to turn off credential/env persistence in hardened
deployments.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_SPECIALIST_INHERIT_SECRET_ENV` | Unset (`1`) | Bash-enabled specialist subprocesses inherit the limited provider credential set by default: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, and AWS Bedrock credential/config vars. Set to `0` only when the `claude` CLI is authenticated through its own config and env credentials must be suppressed. Unrelated secrets such as GitHub and KB tokens remain blocked. |
| `HL_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_AGENT_PERMISSIONS` | Unset (`0`) | Slurm carrier only. Set to `1` only in dedicated internal containers to re-enable legacy Claude/Codex approval and sandbox bypass flags. |

---

## Critic / Robustness / knowledge base (KB)

The following variables configure the Critic, Robustness, and knowledge base components.

| Variable                              | Default                | Description                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_`<br>`LOCAL_KB_ROOT`             | `$USER_DATA_PATH/kb`   | Filesystem root for the local recipe-snapshot KB store (always the write target). Overridden by `--local-kb-root`. See [Integrate Recipe knowledge base in Hyperloom](integrate-kb.md).             |
| `GBRAIN_BASE_URL`                     | Unset                  | Base URL of the remote recipe-snapshot page store — the **read** side of the recipe KB. When unset, recipe reads are local-only.       |
| `GBRAIN_TOKEN`                        | Unset                  | Bearer token for `GBRAIN_BASE_URL`.                                                                                                   |
| `RECIPE_KB_MIRROR_MODE`               | `external`             | `external` (default): a separate ingest process mirrors the local store into the remote recipe KB. `inline`: best-effort mirror each local write into the remote store in-process (local write stays authoritative). |
| `CRITIC_AGENT_ROOT`                   | Derived from `REPO_ROOT` | Override location of the critic-agent runtime.                                                                                    |
| `ROBUSTNESS_AGENT_ROOT`               | Derived from `REPO_ROOT` | Override location of the robustness-agent runtime.                                                                                |
| `ROBUSTNESS_LLM_RCA_DISABLED`         | Unset                  | Set to `1` to forcibly disable the LLM root cause analysis (RCA) engine even when credentials are present.                                                 |

## Session / observability hand-off

These are read by `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/session/manifest.py` and the `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/breakdown/collectors/`
package to populate `session_breakdown.json` for downstream consumers.

| Variable          | Description                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLAW_SESSION_ID` | Hosted SaFE / Claw session id, written to `session.claw_session_id` in `session_breakdown.json`. Set by the Primus-Claw sandbox; unset for local runs. |
| `SANDBOX_USER_ID` | Hosted SaFE / Claw user id, written to `session.sandbox_user_id`. Set by Primus-Claw; unset for local runs.                                            |
| `HYPERLOOM_LANGFUSE_ENABLE` | Primary switch (default **off**) for live Langfuse trace push. See details below. |

**`HYPERLOOM_LANGFUSE_ENABLE`** details:

Primary switch (default **off**) for live Langfuse trace push.

- **SDK install**: when this flag is on, `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh` auto-installs the optional `langfuse` SDK on demand and skips it entirely when off — no separate `pip install '...[trace]'` is required.
- **Live push**: when set to `1/true/yes/on` and the three `LANGFUSE_*` credentials are present, every in-process LLM call is mirrored into Langfuse while the run is live. A session-end flush backfills out-of-process children (geak, forge, robustness, specialist) and KEEP/REVERT decision Scores.
- **Local ledger**: `reports/trace/*.jsonl` is always written regardless of this flag. If the SDK is unavailable, live push degrades to a no-op.
- **Correlation**: the Langfuse trace ID and `session_id` grouping are derived from `claw_session_id` (env `CLAW_SESSION_ID`), falling back to the internal session ID for standalone runs. Live push and the offline `backfill_langfuse` CLI collapse onto one trace per Primus-Claw session.
- **Span layout**: `trace → phase span (PRELUDE/FRAMEWORK_AGENT/EXPLORE/KERNEL_AGENT/SWEEP/…) → agent span (component: orchestration/kernel/specialist/critic/geak/forge/…) → Generation`. Each KEEP/REVERT/`gain_pct` Score attaches to the agent span that produced the decision, with a trace-level fallback when no matching span exists.
- **Recipe-KB spans**: under the `recipe_kb` agent span, both directions of the cross-session recipe KB are recorded — `kb:recipe_snapshot:<method>` for reads (`get_recipe` / `search`) and `kb:recipe_write:<generator>` for writes. The generator suffix separates the session-opening `t0_anchor` identity stamp from the `coordinator` KEEP/REVERT/PR/CLOSE amends. Because a write rewrites the whole row, each write span carries `<field>_delta` metadata (`lessons_delta`, `pitfalls_delta`, …) reporting what that write actually contributed — a restamp that adds nothing shows no delta keys, so it is distinguishable from a real amend. The full audit row is attached as span output.
- **Receipt**: every session records a `langfuse` section in `session_breakdown.json` (and `reports/trace/langfuse_receipt.json`) noting:
  - Whether push was enabled (or the `disabled_reason`)
  - The redacted connection config (host and key-presence booleans — never the keys themselves)
  - The derived `trace_id` and `session_id`
  - How many generations, scores, and spans were sent

  This lets an operator confirm post-hoc whether a run reached Langfuse.

### Langfuse and artifact-package — security and known limitations

* **Sensitive data surface**: When live push is on, `conversations.jsonl`
  (and Langfuse Generations) carry full prompt/response text. `redact_secrets`
  scrubs common token shapes (Bearer, `sk-`/`pk-`, GitHub tokens, some
  `KEY=value`) but is not a complete data loss prevention (DLP) filter — bare keys without a
  recognizable prefix (for example, raw AWS `AKIA…`) can slip through. The artifact
  packager also copies `reports/trace/*.jsonl` and, with the loose mode on by
  default (`HYPERLOOM_SESSION_PACKAGE_LOOSE`), drops them under `/workspace`
  for the Claw sync. If a session might contain customer code or secrets, define
  an explicit retention + access-control policy for both the Langfuse project
  and the `/workspace` package destination, and consider disabling live push
  or loose packaging for those runs.
* **`live push` + `backfill_langfuse` overlap**: Both derive the same
  `trace_id` from `claw_session_id`, so running the offline backfill *after* a
  live run re-emits the out-of-process children onto the same trace and can
  duplicate observations. Use one path per session, or treat backfill as a
  recovery tool only when live push did not run.
* **`flush_session` is idempotent**: A second flush only re-writes the receipt
  (no re-emit), so a duplicated CLOSE step won't double-push.
* **Package truncation**: The bundle caps at 5000 files / 256 MB. On a very
  long session the cap can stop the bundle short; the `PACKAGE_MANIFEST` then
  sets `truncated: true` and lists `dropped_files`, so consumers must not treat
  a truncated package as complete.
* **Generation duration is ~0**: Both live and backfill stamp a single
  timestamp (`end == start`), so Langfuse shows no meaningful per-Generation
  duration — counts/usage are accurate, latency is not captured.

### `token_usage` section (in `session_breakdown.json`)

Every breakdown carries a top-level `token_usage` section: a promoted,
discoverable rollup of LLM token spend derived from the per-call ledger
(`reports/trace/llm_calls.jsonl` + `ext/*.jsonl`). It is purely derived from
`decision_trace.token_rollup`, so it always reconciles with that section. No
env var controls it; it is always present (zeroed on pre-trace sessions).

* `session_total`: whole-session total across every call, with two
  convenience figures: `total_in_out` (prompt + completion only) and
  `grand_total` (in + out + all cache-creation + cache-read tokens).
* `by_component`: per-agent breakdown (orchestration / kernel / critic /
  specialist / proposal_scorer / geak / forge / …), each with the same
  convenience totals.
* `by_phase`: per-phase breakdown (PRELUDE / FRAMEWORK_AGENT / EXPLORE / KERNEL_AGENT / SWEEP / CLOSE).
* `attribution`: `attributed_to_decisions` vs `unattributed` split plus
  `attributed_calls_pct`. Only calls that carry a `task_id` / `dyn_id` joining
  to a KEEP/REVERT or dynamic_action decision (for example, specialist subprocess
  turns) are attributed; orchestration / kernel / critic / proposal_scorer
  turns are LLM-internal and land in `unattributed` (this is expected, not a
  gap in the data).
* `timeline`: each `action_timeline` row annotated with the tokens that join
  to it on `task_id`. Rows whose action has no LLM spend show `tokens: null`
  (rather than a zero bucket) to make the sparsity explicit.

To get the single "total tokens for this run" number, read
`token_usage.session_total.grand_total` (all-in) or `.total_in_out`
(prompt+completion only).

## Variables intentionally not exposed

These are read by `os.environ` somewhere in the codebase but are
internal-only — do not set them by hand:

* `HYPERLOOM_KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT`: internal CLI-only handoff to the
  kernel subprocess (Python constant `_KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT_ENV`).
* Any `_INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_*_INTERNAL_*` symbol: internal toggles for
  the test suite.

If you find one of these in a log message, treat it as diagnostic
detail rather than something you should tune.
