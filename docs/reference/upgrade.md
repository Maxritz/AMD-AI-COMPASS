# Upgrade Hyperloom version

Per-version migration steps. This page is a companion to
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md): the changelog answers *what
changed*, this page answers *what you have to do about it*.

If you are starting fresh, skip this page and follow the
[installation instructions](../install/install.md).

---

## Conventions

These labels are used throughout this page to indicate urgency:

* **Required**: Your run will fail or behave incorrectly until you do
  this.
* **Recommended**: Your run will still work, but you'll get a
  deprecation warning or sub-optimal behavior.
* **Optional**: Strictly improves UX or unlocks new features.

Hyperloom doesn't mutate your `.env` on upgrade; all migrations
below are explicit.

## Upgrading from 0.5.x → 0.6.0

Apply the following changes in order. Required steps must be completed before running; recommended and optional steps improve behavior or unlock new features.

### Required: rename `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_SESSION_DIR` → `USER_DATA_PATH`

The session directory env was renamed and the legacy variable is no
longer read. Any launcher that exports the old name will silently
fall back to the default `/workspace/hyperloom` instead of honouring
your override.

```diff
# .env, run launchers, k8s ConfigMaps
- INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_SESSION_DIR=/shared/hyperloom-sessions/me
+ USER_DATA_PATH=/shared/hyperloom-sessions/me
```

Same for `WORKSPACE_PATH` — it is legacy-only and still used in narrow
fallbacks, but new launchers should rename it to `USER_DATA_PATH`.

### Required: rename multi-node image / GPU flags and envs

The `optimize` CLI multi-node image and per-node GPU flags were renamed
and the legacy names are no longer accepted (no alias). Any launcher that
passes the old flags will fail with `unrecognized arguments`. The image
and per-node GPU count are now set purely through flags; the previous
`INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAYJOB_IMAGE` env is no longer read, so move its value
onto `--mn-image`.

```diff
# run launchers, k8s ConfigMaps, .env
- --rayjob-image harbor/...
+ --mn-image harbor/...
- --rayjob-gpus-per-node 8
+ --gpus-per-node 8
- INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAYJOB_IMAGE=harbor/...
+ --mn-image harbor/...
```

The new flags cover both multi-node backends (`rayjob` head+workers and
`infera` worker/prefill/decode pods), which is why they dropped the
`rayjob`-specific prefix.

### Recommended: review `--model-class` if you relied on live classification

The live `classify` action was removed. Current Coordinator boot still infers
and persists `model_class` from model metadata or model-path family keywords
when possible, but launchers that know the class should pass it explicitly to
avoid a generic fallback:

```diff
python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize \
    --model /path/to/GLM-5-FP8 \
    --framework sglang \
    --gpu-type mi355x \
+   --model-class moe_mla_nsa \
    --isl 1024 --osl 1024 \
    --max-hours 2.0
```

Recognised `--model-class` values (case-insensitive, with `-`/`+`/space
tolerated; see [Inference Optimizer Skill](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/blob/main/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md)):
`dense`, `moe_mla`, `moe_swa`, `moe_mla_nsa`.

If `--model-class` is omitted and inference cannot determine the family, the
Coordinator falls back to a generic dense prior — likely sub-optimal for mixture of experts (MoE) /
multi-head latent attention (MLA) / native sparse attention (NSA) models.

### Required: pass `--compare-against-gpu` to opt into InferenceX reference fetching

The `classify` action used to derive this implicitly. Without
`--compare-against-gpu`, `target_analysis` writes a
`no_target_gpu_configured` marker and the run proceeds without an
external reference (the optimisation still works; you just don't get
the "vs B200" comparison number).

```diff
+ --compare-against-gpu B200
```

### Required: setup is no longer an in-loop action

Earlier launchers might have waited for the Coordinator to emit a
`setup` action. Move all setup work to **before** the
`python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize` call:

```diff
# launcher.sh
- python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize ... # expects setup as first action
+ bash "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
+ . "${KERNEL_AGENT_ENV:-${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh}"
+ ray stop --force; ulimit -Sn "${RAY_MIN_NOFILE:-65536}" 2>/dev/null || true; ray start --head --num-gpus="$RAY_NUM_GPUS" --include-dashboard=false
+ python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize ...
```

### Recommended: review the `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER` default

Bare-metal installs now default `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER` to `geak`. If you
had a custom order hard-coded, confirm it is still intentional.

### Recommended: set `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RESCUE_PATHS` if you use model-specific benchmark scripts

When `--gpu-type` is set, Hyperloom pins
`benchmark_script=<framework>_<gpu_type>.sh` to stop InferenceX-native
scripts from leaking `result.json` outside the session dir. If you
intentionally use a model-specific script (for example, `dsr1_fp8_mi300x.sh`),
keep passing `benchmark_script=` explicitly — operator overrides
still win against the generic-script pin. You might additionally want
to set `$INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RESCUE_PATHS` so the harvest step can
recover any leaked `result.json` files written to hardcoded
`--result-dir` locations.

### Recommended: stop expecting `standalone_analysis.md` or `tracelens_report.md`

The kernel-agent no longer aliases the TraceLens v0.3 report. The
canonical analysis path is now surfaced by the `trace_analyze` request
handler as `trace_report_path` and forwarded to the lifecycle as
`analysis_report_path` (pointing at
`$SESSION_DIR/kernel-agent/runs/<session_id>/tracelens/analysis.md`).
The `--compat-report-path` argument was removed.

### Roofline is now on by default (no PMC env toggle)

There is no `HYPERLOOM_ENABLE_PMC_ROOFLINE` environment variable. Roofline
analysis (the composite `profile` + `trace_analyze` + `analysis.md` path) is
controlled by the CLI flag `--enable-roofline`, which defaults **on**. Pass
`--no-enable-roofline` for a profile-only run. See
[Environment variables](environment-variables.md).

### Schema compatibility

`session_breakdown.json` emits `hyperloom.session_breakdown.v5.0`. V5 is a
breaking cutover for optimization results: adopted optimizations are reported
only through `optimizations`, and the `optimization_stack`, `attribution`, GEAK
invocation, Forge invocation, and GEMM-tuning projections are no longer
emitted. Consumers reading archived v2 / v3 / v4 documents need a downstream
migration, as described in
[`session_breakdown.json` integration in Hyperloom](session-breakdown.md).

---

## Upgrading from pre-0.5 (training and MLPerf-training)

Hyperloom is **inference-only** since v0.4. If you are still on a
training-mode build:

* The training-mode TraceLens CLI
  (`TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch_training`) is no longer
  accepted by `install.sh`. Use the `_inference` variant.
* Training and MLPerf-training skills have been removed from this
  repo. There is no in-place migration; switch to the inference flow
  documented in the [setup and examples guide](../../examples/README.md).

---

## Generic upgrade procedure

For any minor or patch upgrade:

1. Pull the new Hyperloom revision into `$REPO_ROOT`.
2. Re-run `bash "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"`. The
   installer is idempotent: it picks up new GEAK / TraceLens versions,
   refreshes generated LLM gateway aliases, and regenerates `kernel-agent.env.sh`.
3. Re-source the env file:
   ```bash
   . "${KERNEL_AGENT_ENV:-${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh}"
   ```
4. If you have ongoing sessions you want to resume across the upgrade,
   verify `manifest.json` and `state.json` are intact, then run
   `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize --resume`.

Upgrades **do not** touch `HYPERLOOM_LOCAL_KB_ROOT` or `$USER_DATA_PATH`.
Your local KB and historical sessions are preserved.
