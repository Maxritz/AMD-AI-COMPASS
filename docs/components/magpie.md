# Magpie

Magpie is a lightweight, general-purpose framework for evaluating GPU kernel
correctness and performance on AMD (HIP) GPUs. It exposes
three evaluation modes — Analyze, Compare, and Benchmark — plus framework-level
(vLLM / SGLang / Atom) benchmarking with built-in TraceLens trace analysis.

Within Hyperloom, Magpie is the benchmark engine. The kernel agent and the
optimization loop drive Magpie to spin up a serving framework, run the workload,
collect traces, and emit a structured `benchmark_report.json` file; those traces are
the input that [TraceLens](tracelens.md) then analyzes. Magpie relies on
[IntelliKit](intellikit.md) for some low-level GPU profiling tools.

## Role in Hyperloom

The optimization loop drives Magpie's benchmark mode as a subprocess. The
command line is built by `build_benchmark_command()` /
`MagpieBackend.build_command()` in
`src/hyperloom/orchestrator/actions/executors/benchmark_backend.py`; callers
such as `_grid_runner.py` and `baseline.py` invoke it to launch one run per
variant:

```python
cmd = [
    magpie_python, "-m", "Magpie", "-v", "benchmark",
    "--benchmark-config", str(config_path),
    "--output-dir", str(output_dir),
    "--run-mode", "local",
]
```

Each run produces a `benchmark_report.json` that Hyperloom parses to extract
throughput/measurements and pick winners. To make concurrent benchmark runs
robust, `src/hyperloom/orchestrator/actions/executors/_magpie_patcher.py`
applies an idempotent, atomic-write patch to Magpie's installed `benchmarker.py`
(`_prepare_benchmark_scripts`) so a concurrent reader never sees a half-copied
script. See [Hyperloom optimization loop](../conceptual/optimization-loop.md) for more information.
