# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [v1.0.0a3] - 2026-08-05
Current packaged version (`pyproject.toml`). See
[release notes](docs/release-notes.md) and the
[GitHub release](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/releases/tag/v1.0.0a3)
for the user-facing summary.

### Added

- **Recipe-KB writes in the Langfuse trace**: every write to the cross-session
  recipe KB (`recipe.json`) is now mirrored as a `kb:recipe_write:<generator>`
  span under the `recipe_kb` agent, alongside the existing
  `kb:recipe_snapshot:<method>` read spans. Both write sites are covered — the
  session-opening T0 identity anchor (`generator=t0_anchor`) and the
  Coordinator's KEEP/REVERT/framework-PR/CLOSE amends
  (`generator=coordinator`), the latter carrying the session's lessons,
  pitfalls, `best_config`, `prs_tested`, `what_worked`/`what_failed` and
  `sessions` entries. Previously only reads were visible, so what a session
  sank into the KB could only be recovered by diffing `history/v*.json`.

  `RecipeKB.put_recipe` emits the audit event (reusing the existing
  `audit_hook` → `runtime/recipe_snapshot/.audit.jsonl` channel), so the
  offline `backfill_langfuse` CLI replays write spans too. Each event reports a
  per-field `delta` against the pre-write row — `put_recipe` rewrites the whole
  row, so absolute counts alone cannot distinguish an amend that appended a
  lesson from the T0 anchor, which round-trips the existing lists untouched.
  Read spans are unchanged, and audit rows predating this change (no `op`
  field) still replay as reads. On-disk recipe rows are untouched: this is a
  trace mirror, so warm-start reads the same data as before.

  `LocalRecipeStore.put_recipe` now additionally returns `prior_counts` and
  `counts` (per-field sizes before/after the write) to support the delta.

### Removed

- **Remote Cortex KB, end to end**: every path that could reach a remote Cortex
  KB is gone, not just its CLI wiring. `--cortex-kb-url` is removed, and the
  Critic's `/v2/reasoning/assess` client (`kb_assess_client.py`) is deleted
  along with the bundle fields (`kb_assess_by_proposal`, `kb_assess_trace`),
  the prompt injection, and the Langfuse `kb_assess` span. `CORTEX_KB_URL`,
  `CORTEX_KB_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SEC` and `CORTEX_KB_ASSESS_INJECT` are no longer read
  anywhere, so setting them in `.env` or the shell has no effect — previously
  the Critic would still call out if the variable reached its environment by
  any route. No Hyperloom code makes outbound requests to a Cortex KB.
- **Specialist `cortex_kb` MCP**: Specialists no longer receive
  `mcp__cortex_kb__*` tools or a `cortex_kb` MCP server in
  `specialist_mcp.json`. PR Monitor MCP remains available when configured.
- **IR-3 preflight**: Remote recipe-KB reachability probe removed; IR-3 now
  probes PR Monitor only. `--degraded-kb` no longer disables PR Monitor.
- **Recipe KB with `--degraded-kb`**: T0/T2/T3/T4 are skipped (`recipe_kb=None`).
- **PolicyGate R4 (`kb_write_unauthorized`)**: removed. `KB_WRITE_TOOL_NAMES`
  was empty, so the rule could never fire while its comment still claimed it
  guarded KB writes. Local Recipe KB writes go through direct Python calls
  (`writeback.py` / `proposals.py`), which R4 never covered. R5
  (`tool_whitelist_role`) is unchanged and still gates PR Monitor / Web tools.

### Changed

- **breaking: `cortex_*` renamed to `recipe_*`**. After the remote Cortex KB
  was removed, the names left behind held a *local* `RecipeKB` and no longer
  referred to anything called Cortex. Renamed across code, prompts and
  serialized data:
  - Python API: `Coordinator.cortex_kb` → `.recipe_kb`, `args.cortex_enabled` →
    `args.recipe_kb_enabled`, `_bootstrap_cortex_kb()` → `_bootstrap_recipe_kb()`,
    `cortex_finalize_recipe_and_journal()` → `finalize_recipe_and_journal()`,
    `_cortex_t4_hook()` → `_recipe_kb_t4_hook()`, and the module
    `orchestrator.knowledge.cortex_t0` → `.recipe_kb_t0`.
  - CLI: `--cortex-strict-fingerprint` → `--recipe-kb-strict-fingerprint`.
    No alias is kept; the legacy flag now fails argparse.
  - Emitted data: SharedState `cortex_session_id` / `cortex_session_summary` →
    `recipe_kb_*`; breakdown `kb_provenance.cortex_session_id` →
    `recipe_kb_session_id`; stop reasons `cortex_t0_failed` /
    `cortex_drain_failed` / `cortex_commit_failed` → `recipe_kb_*`; warm-recipe
    source tag `cortex-kb` → `recipe-kb`; sweep grid source `cortex_recipe` →
    `recipe_kb`. Consumers that parse these values need updating.
  - On disk: `<session>/runtime/cortex/` → `<session>/runtime/recipe_kb/`.
    No migration is provided and none is needed: this directory holds only
    derived bookkeeping, while the authoritative recipe store is the local KB
    root (mirrored to gbrain) outside the session tree. Resuming an older
    session regenerates the snapshots on its next T0 anchor.

  Note: this does **not** touch Primus Cortex (`agents/framework/sources/primus_cortex.py`,
  `PRIMUS_CORTEX_PR_API`), which shares only the word "Cortex" with the removed
  KB. It is the framework-agent's PR-candidate source and the backend behind
  PR Monitor (`--pr-monitor-url` defaults to `$PRIMUS_CORTEX_PR_API`), which
  this release keeps.

## [v1.0.0a2] - 2026-07-29
See [release notes](docs/release-notes.md) and the
[GitHub release](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/releases/tag/v1.0.0a2)
for the user-facing summary.

- **breaking(inference_optimizer)**: rename the multi-node `optimize` CLI
   flags `--rayjob-image` → `--mn-image` and `--rayjob-gpus-per-node` →
   `--gpus-per-node`, covering both the `rayjob` and `infera` multi-node
   backends. No alias is kept; the legacy flags now fail argparse. The former
   `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_RAYJOB_IMAGE` env is no longer read — set the image via
   `--mn-image`. See the [upgrade guide](docs/reference/upgrade.md).
- **feat(inference_optimizer)**: add RDNA4 GPU support (RX 9070 XT, RX 9070,
   RX 9060 XT, RX 9000 XT) for Windows HIP-ROCm 7.3 via `hipConfig --show-device`
   autodetection. RDNA4 uses WMMA matrix instructions (not dedicated MFMA cores),
   with FP8 native support and 16GB GDDR6 @ 640 GB/s memory bandwidth.
- **feat(orchestrator)**: absorb PR #461 free-form dynamic specialist
   dispatch. The orchestration agent can `delegate{action_name='dynamic_specialist'}`
   to spawn CPU-only, non-domain-locked specialist sub-agents (claude CLI
   subprocesses) in waves, plus `dynamic_specialist_check` / `_collect`.
   Adds the ActionRegistry `_meta` registration PR #461 omitted (so the
   delegate is no longer denied with `unknown_action` and renders in the
   prompt catalogue), wires the dispatch model to the blessed specialist /
   orchestration model, and adds a liveness reaper that kills timed-out /
   stale subprocesses (process-group SIGTERM/SIGKILL) so the run never
   leaks zombie agents.
- Add repository governance docs (LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Add structured Sphinx documentation under `docs/`: install guides, how-to
   guides, reference material, component pages, release notes, and compatibility
   docs.
- Refresh the optimization-loop documentation under
  `docs/conceptual/optimization-loop.md` and add
  `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/README.md` as a package-level entry point.
- README now links to the structured docs from its "Get Started" and
  "Documentation" sections.
- **fix(orchestrator)**: drop pre-M4 `select_kernels` request alias and the
  legacy `SharedState.last_select_kernels` / `record_select_kernels` mirror.
  Only the canonical `trace_analyze` kind / `last_trace_analyze` cache
  remain; readers had previously checked the removed mirror in
  `_kernel_phase_todos` TODO 3/5, which caused the KERNEL-phase
  `trace_analyze` request loop (RooflineExecutor populated only the
  canonical cache, so the guard never saw a fresh entry and forever
  instructed the LLM to re-emit the request). Resume of a stale
  `state.json` carrying `last_select_kernels` silently drops the slot
  via `_legacy_drop_fields`.
